          A <em>strange loop</em> can be seen as a form of recursion that
          creates a sense of infinity: it describes elements that appear
          repeated in self-similar ways. The piece
          <em>I am a Strange Loop </em>is inspired by this idea but in relation
          to how our self and consciousness can arise out of mere organic
          matter. According to Douglas Hofstadter, our consciousness and self
          are a result of complex self-referential loops in the brain. Our sense
          of self arises from the recursive processes of thought, reflection,
          and self-awareness. In this piece, I investigated this idea and its
          metaphorical translation into a musical narrative. From a constructive
          standpoint, I have formalized several musical parameters from a
          preexistent composition –the Canon No. 3 from
          <em>The Musical Offering,</em> BWV 1079, by J. S. Bach– and
          resynthesized them into a new musical work in a way that these
          parameters emerge across multiple new musical dimensions, such as
          pitch system, rhythm, tempo and dynamics. In addition, part of the
          artistic investigation in this piece was focused on generating
          real-time synthesis and sound processing based on brain data readings
          using an fNIRS helmet, through the use of a newly developed software
          interface that communicates between the fNIRS helmet and Ableton Live.

        In this section, I will discuss a compositional approach that has the
        potential to expand on some of the ideas presented earlier, particularly
        the single-domain approach (described as a characteristic of
        connectionist models) and some limitations of symbolic AI systems in the
        same regard as well. I am referring to
        <em>abstraction.</em> As will be further discussed above, abstraction
        mainly relies on the successful translation<span
          class="popover-container"
        >
          *<span class="popover-content"
            ><em>Translation</em> here is understood as the process of
            converting information from one domain to one or other domains
            through symbolic relationships and mappings. translation is
            intrinsically tied to hermeneutics –the theory and methodology of
            interpretation –which originated in the analysis of sacred and
            philosophical texts. Hermeneutics reflects the dual capacity of
            language to both reveal and obscure truth. For example, in religious
            contexts, interpretive principles were developed to resolve textual
            inconsistencies and uncover deeper meanings within sacred texts.
            Ultimately, translation, hermeneutics, and aesthetics can be seen as
            processes of uncovering deeper realities through interpretive acts.
            For example, Hans-Georg Gadamer’s hermeneutical aesthetics builds on
            these theses. Gadamer argues that art’s immediate impact prompts
            reflection, by fostering an understanding that transcends mere
            aesthetic pleasure. However, Gadamer sees art as resistant to
            reduction into conceptual knowledge or translation into other
            mediums. This possibility of multiple interpretations grants the
            artwork an ideality of possible meanings (<strong
              >Hans-Georg Gadamer,</strong
            >
            <em>The relevance of the beautiful and other essays,</em> Cambridge
            UP, 1986, p.146), making it inherently more than any single
            reading.</span
          ></span
        >
        of information across diverse domains. Therefore, I view these two
        concepts as closely connected. In what comes next, I will explore how
        abstraction and translation can act as human cognitive capacities that
        have the potential to spark musical narratives.
      </p>

      <p>
        I will outline some processes I have primarily used as vehicles for
        cross-domain translation of musical information and representation. As I
        see it, this process potentially serves to connect the threads I have so
        far presented independently –or rather, to intertwine them. The
        techniques I will discuss are all fundamentally connected and derived
        from processes of <em>sonification.</em> From there, I identify two main
        types: one that produces symbolic musical information and another that
        generates raw digital audio signals. In addition, I will discuss some
        applications of principles of remapping and transformation of musical
        profiles, as well as their utilization as structures that span across
        different musical domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abstraction lies at the core of what potentially defines us as humans
        and what defines art. Therefore, it can be approached from multiple
        perspectives, exceeding the somewhat limited views from psychology and
        artificial intelligence and moving towards more philosophical, cultural,
        religious, and even aesthetical views. However, I will maintain a
        relatively narrow scope –as I have throughout this text– focusing on the
        topic mainly from a psychological approach and its potential emulation
        within computational frameworks. To maintain consistency with the
        structure of the previous chapters, I will begin the discussion of
        abstraction from a cognitive perspective.

      <h3>Abstraction</h3>

      <p>
        The human mind is capable of identifying patterns through our sensory
        systems. abstraction involves isolating a common feature or relationship
        observed across multiple elements and often focuses on essential
        qualities by removing specific, individual, or recognizable
        details.<span class="popover-container"

        Human experience often involves sensory and motor dimensions that are
        closely interconnected. When operating in the real world, humans must
        deal with sensory uncertainty and efficiently process continuous streams
        of multisensory information. The capacity for abstraction in humans is
        likely supported by the integration of sensory-motor associations and
        multimodal processing areas in the brain,<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            ><em>Multimodal</em> processing areas in the brain are regions that
            integrate information from multiple sensory modalities. One example
            of a multimodal processing area is thesuperior temporal sulcus
            <em>superior temporal sulcus</em> (STS), which integrates auditory
            and visual information, like speech and facial expressions</span

        Sometimes, the neural pathways responsible for processing different
        types of sensory information in the brain form unusual
        cross-connections. One rare manifestation of this is
        <em>synesthesia,</em> a perceptual phenomenon where stimulation of one
        sensory pathway involuntarily triggers experiences in another, for
        example, seeing colors when hearing music. A notable case of synesthesia
        is the composer Olivier Messiaen, who suggested that his synesthetic
        experiences influenced his compositional work:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “And I realized that (…) I also associate colors with sounds, but
          intellectually, not with my eyes. In fact, for as long as I can
          remember, whenever I hear or read music, I see in my mind complexes of
          colors that move and shift with the sound complexes.”

        For example, he writes about the piece
        <em>Couleurs de la Cité Céleste</em> (1963):
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “The form of this work depends entirely on colors. The melodic or
          rhythmic themes, the combinations of sounds and timbres, evolve in the
          manner of colors. In their perpetually renewed variations, one can
          find (by analogy) warm and cool colors, complementary colors
          influencing their neighbors, colors fading toward white, or subdued by
          black. These transformations can also be compared to characters acting
          on several overlapping stages, simultaneously unfolding multiple
          different stories.”

        As discussed previously, connectionist models, particularly neural
        networks, are very good at identifying patterns and generalizing them.
        However, they cannot directly apply this knowledge across different
        domains. They are only effective within their specific domain. Recent
        research carried out in the field of AI has addressed this problem, and
        some results are starting to show that new, more advanced systems can
        effectively transfer and operate on multimodal information. These
        systems, however, typically rely on separate and independent mechanisms
        for processing unimodal representations, where each modality operates
        without influencing the others.<span class="popover-container"

        They normally consist of separate neural networks trained on parallel
        datasets –each from a different modality– and establish some mapping
        between their intermediate layers and posterior training of a new model
        based on these abstract mappings.<span class="popover-container">

        The field of multimodal learning in AI and deep learning is advancing
        rapidly. Achieving strong multimodal learning capabilities could bring
        AI models one step closer to replicating human intelligence and
        reasoning. For now, however, this goal remains largely unrealized.

      <p>
        In contrast, humans can efficiently abstract information from one domain
        and reinterpret it in another. In some cases, abstraction simplifies
        complex forms into simpler, often non-representational elements. In
        other cases, it goes beyond a mere reduction of detail and becomes a
        re-interpretation of meaning and essence: it becomes a form of
        reconstruction and reshaping of meaning across different sensory
        modalities, mediums, languages, or modes of expression. It allows
        engagement with forms and concepts on a more general level without
        directly referencing reality. At the core of abstraction lies the notion
        of interpretive engagement, as perceivers mentally reconstruct and
        interpret what they see or hear through their own experiences and
        understanding. This ability to perform cross-modal translations has been
        a powerful driving force in artistic production. Abstraction, therefore,
        lies at the core of what we understand as art.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “While art enacts its separation from nature through its artificial
          character, it simultaneously conceals an inherent dependence on
          natural beauty. Art appears as the opposite of nature—what is not
          made—yet ‘as pure antithesis… each refers to the other: nature to
          experience of a mediated and objectified world, the artwork to nature
          as the mediated plenipotentiary of immediacy.’”

        The use of technology has the potential to enhance our creative capacity
        for abstraction and enable explorations of diverse forms of translation,
        particularly in domains involving large volumes of information. In the
        following sections, I will discuss how technology is utilized in this
        project to explore processes of abstraction and the translation of
        information across domains, mainly resulting in sound and musical
        representation.
