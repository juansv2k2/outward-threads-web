      <h3>Composition and Generative AI</h3>

      <p>
        At the very beginning of my research, I started experimenting with AI,
        in particular with symbolic AI –often so-called GOFAI (Good Old Fashion
        Artificial Intelligence). Later, I started incorporating into my
        practice methods from Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). DL
        lies at the core of the big gen-AI models, such as ChatGPT and others.
        Even though the scale of implementation and development of these methods
        in my artistic research project is relatively small, I believe that
        their mere inclusion in my practice is enough to raise important ethical
        considerations that deserve thoughtful reflection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The boom of gen-AI happened long after I started my research position.
        On November 30, 2022 –the day after my Ph.D. midway evaluation, ChatGPT
        3.5 was publicly released.<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content"
            >Before that I was already aware of some of the advancements of
            OpenAI in the field, and in fact I had the pre-trained GPT-2 model
            in my hard-drive. I carried out some experiments with it that led to
            an idea for a piece in which this model would receive, as prompts,
            verses of poems by Nelly Sacks and output some text that would be
            projected in real time in a screen. In the end, this project was
            never finished.</span
          ></span
        >
        Very shortly after, the sudden awareness of its imminent social,
        cultural, and historical impact had an unexpected and profound effect on
        my ideas around AI and, naturally, on my artistic research process. In
        short, almost all my ideas and the philosophical foundation of the
        project entered a profound crisis, triggering an on-the-fly
        reevaluation, not only of technical aspects but, more importantly, of
        the ethical implications of using gen-AI as a composer or artist. This
        reevaluation extended to the evolving societal role of these systems,
        their integration into daily life, and ultimately, their broader impact
        on humanity as a species.
      </p>

      <p>
        As of today, I believe that we are on the verge of a historical change,
        and it is hard to foresee a clear picture of what the future will be for
        humans in relation to AI. That being said, I believe that an extended
        discussion around the social, cultural, and economic implications of new
        advancements in AI is way outside the scope of this project. In this
        sense, I will try to keep the reflection within the general field of art
        creation, and in particular, music. However, I believe that fully
        dodging the existential discussion around the matter is not possible,
        and eventually, I have felt the need for more general reflections, even
        though, for this text, I have tried to maintain it to the minimum
        necessary.
      </p>

      <h4>Authorship, copyright, and ownership</h4>
      <p>
        The first aspect that caught my interest around gen-AI is the use of
        datasets consisting of large amounts of preexisting music to train
        models for generating new musical material. The newly generated music,
        of course, keeps some resemblance to the training data. I experimented
        with this methodology in my cycle <em>Oscillations.</em> But let me come
        back to <em>Oscillations</em> later to not spoil some of my ideas on the
        matter yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        This problem is not necessarily new in music. I can think of musical
        quotations, along with many other compositional techniques that use
        preexisting music in ways that allow a listener to recognize –more or
        less clearly– the source as not created by the current composer. This
        has been a common practice from the music of the Renaissance to the
        music of our days. Yes, this is a large and heterogeneous time frame to
        consider. Potentially, the analogy could be restricted to music composed
        after February 15, 1972, marking a relevant date when fixed recordings
        became subject to ownership protection in the United States.
      </p>

      <p>
        This moves me to compare it with a preexisting compositional technique,
        that of <em>sampling.</em> And I think here of the paradigmatic example
        of sampling –and probably the closest in terms of implications with
        gen-AI, as many procedures seem equivalent in both as well as the legal
        framework that seems to encompass them– the genre “Plunderphonics,”<span

        started by the composer John Oswald. Oswald’s presentation at the Wired
        Society Electro-Acoustic Conference in Toronto in 1985 remains fully
        valid nowadays, and I highly recommend the complete reading of it. Here
        is how it starts:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Musical instruments produce sounds. Composers produce music. Musical
          instruments reproduce music. Tape recorders, radios, disc players,
          etc., reproduce sound. A device such as a wind-up music box produces
          sound and reproduces music. A phonograph in the hands of a hip
          hop/scratch artist who plays a record like an electronic washboard
          with a phonographic needle as a plectrum produces sounds which are
          unique and not reproduced - the record player becomes a musical
          instrument. A sampler, in essence, a recording, transforming
          instrument, is simultaneously a documenting device and a creative
          device, in effect reducing a distinction manifested by copyright.”

        Essentially, the article emphasizes the visible contradictions and
        blurry limits of the idea of <em>ownership</em> in music by questioning
        the validity of the concept of <em>copyright.</em> Oswald delineates his
        philosophical perspective on the issue, but in addition, he carefully
        reviews an important body of legal regulations on copyright. I propose
        the reader follow this sequence of quotations –some I took from Oswald’s
        presentation, some others I gathered from other sources– which, to my
        understanding, make the problem fairly evident:

      <p>
        Regardless of the last –ironic– quotation, there seems to be a
        significantly high degree of legal ambiguity on this issue. Laws don’t
        really solve the problem here. In addition, one can find a wide range of
        opinions on this issue by different practitioners: composers,
        performers, music producers, DJs, managers, record labels, artistic
        collectives, and so on. It is a difficult issue to take a stand on. My
        perspective on this comes from considering the issue from
        <em>both sides of the counter.</em> However, I believe these questions
        can also be depersonalized and framed within the broader field of
        practice:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>
            Would I be happy if someone takes one of my pieces, alters it
            somehow –but keeps some resemblance to the original– and passes it
            as his/her own?
          </em>
          <strong>No, I would not.</strong> I would see this as ethically and
          morally reprehensible. In this scenario, even though the laws have a
          certain degree of ambiguity, they’d favor my position.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em
            >Would my attitude change whether or not I am asked for
            authorization?</em
          >
          <strong>Probably.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Would this more permissive attitude change if the person
            acknowledges my original authorship and describes his/her agency on
            it as a “contribution” with some sought end?
          </em>
          <strong>Maybe.</strong> Probably, it will depend on the details of the
          endeavor, including potential economic compensation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            Should I assume that my stance on the issue is shared by every
            composer, performer, or artist?
          </em>
          <strong>Certainly not.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Probably, most music makers wouldn’t be happy to have their music being
        fed a neural network that generates an outcome that somehow resembles
        their works. Maybe it doesn’t even resemble it explicitly, rather,
        having some agency on the model’s outcome as to what it is. Most likely,
        these people haven’t been asked for their authorization to include this
        material, and they won’t get any compensation or even credit for
        this.<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content"
            >See for example this recent article in the Washington Post:
            <strong>Johnathan Taplin and T Bone Burnett, </strong>"Opinion | To
            protect human artistry from AI, new safeguards might be essential,"

        However, some others might not have any concerns at all about this,
        considering that their musical spirit –I am not sure if this is a good
        way of defining it– would incarnate in the most motley derivative
        outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, my approach to gen-AI follows some principles. First of all,
        I reject the <em>extractivist</em
        ><span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content"
            >The concept of <em>extractive</em> AI comes from adapting the
            notions of extractive economy to the development and function of big
            AI models. I use the term also relating to the idea of
            indiscriminate gathering of data without any concerns or interest or
            questionings about origin, copyrights, and later use.</span

        use of preexisting data to train these models. Data that is protected by
        copyright should not be included on these datasets unless with
        permission of the authors. That includes also images and any other
        creative content.<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content"
            >At some point, I used images generated by Dall-e 2 and 3 as
            illustrations for some content of the project, such as presentations
            or even record covers. After some reflection around it, I decided to
            take them out from everywhere and not use them at any cost. Later, I
            softened my position a bit, and I allowed myself to use some
            generated content from Adobe Firefly, as long as they maintained an
            ethical stanza aligned with my ideas (see
            <a
              href="https://www.adobe.com/ai/overview/ethics.html"

              >https://www.adobe.com/ai/overview/ethics.html</a
            >). However, later controversies are still arising, and it’s hard to
            keep a rock-solid stanza on the issue.</span
          ></span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Having said that, I can reveal more details on how this stance
        materialized within my creative process. For example, for the
        composition of the pieces <em>Oscillations (i and iii).</em> I used
        symbolic datasets to create models later used for generative purposes.
        In particular, I used the scores of some songs of the cycle
        <em>Winterreise.</em> As Schubert’s music is in the public domain, this
        represents no legal problem. However, in the process of composing the
        piece <em>Oscillations (ii),</em> I experimented with an audio dataset
        to train a generative model.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >I used the tool RAVE, a variational autoencoder for fast and
            high-quality neural audio synthesis, developed by Antoine Caillon

        As recordings of the cycle are protected with copyright, this would have
        been ethically –and possibly legally– problematic. This made me desist
        of the idea for some time. However, I later discovered the Schubert
        <em>Winterreise</em> Dataset (SWD),<span class="popover-container"

        whether that bridges some ethical implications around it.

          These should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

            Is <em>prompting</em> an important aspect of the creative process of

        Well, I have to confess that, throughout the development of
        NeuralConstraints,<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >NeuralConstraints is a CAC tool that combines neural generation

        I saw myself spending significant time finding the right musical prompts
        –in this case, sequences of pitches, pitch classes, intervals, etc.– to
        get the most interesting continuations. Even using NeuralConstraints,
        which is a relatively small-scale neural generative tool, subtle
        differences in prompts had different and curious effects on the results.
        At some point, it became interesting to try out many different
        possibilities, with varying degrees of relation to the original dataset,
        different musical styles, or even combining simultaneously different
        models trained with different datasets, since NeuralConstraints allows
        one to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though the outcome of a gen-AI model always comes in different
        forms, the development of good prompts has become a commercial endeavor,
        and some of them are prone to viralize the same way as other media
        content, such as videos, photos, or audio. Many AI-based artists spend
        many hours trying to define the best prompt that will give them the
        desired result.<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content">
            See for example <strong>Minsuk Chang et al., </strong>"The Prompt
            Artists" (paper presented at the Proceedings of the 15th Conference
            on Creativity and Cognition, 2023).

        In any case, in more recent times, I started to view the notion of
        prompting a bit differently than just a passive engagement. Of course,
        it can be that as well (probably most of the time is). However, the
        notion of prompting has triggered in me a revision of my role as an
        artist, the dynamic of the creative process, the concept of technique,
        materiality, and many more. But these revisions are not something that
        hasn’t already happened throughout history. I can think, for example, of
        the <em>ateliers</em> of the masters of the Rennaissance, where these
        had many apprentices to whom they’d delegate the physical execution of
        their works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in contemporary art, the practice of delegation has been and is
        still crucial to exploring new ideas and concepts without worrying about
        technical or practical aspects. Even nowadays, institutions such as SWR

        provide technical assessment to composers for projects related to live
        electronics/electroacoustic music. In diverse artistic fields, many
        forms of collaborative development of works are possible, especially
        involving high-end technology, like immersive and interactive systems
        and VR.<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content"

        However, there have also been ethical conflicts around this. In the book
        <em>Artificial,</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            ><strong>Mariano Sigman and Santiago Bilinkis,</strong>
            <em
              >Artificial: la nueva inteligencia y el contorno de lo humano</em
            >
            (Debate, 2023).</span
          ></span
        >
        Bilinkis and Sigman bring the example of the Italian artist Maurizio
        Cattelan, the creator of the piece <em>Comedian</em> in 2019. The name
        might not say much, but the piece is very well-known, as it consists of
        a fresh banana taped to a wall that got two copies sold for the
        remarkable price of USD 120.000 each.<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content"
            >Update: the new price of <em>Comedian</em> in November of 2024 is
            USD 6.24 millions.</span
          ></span
        >
        Apparently, Cattelan is a very prolific generator of ideas, and he would
        commission the technical realization of these to the French sculptor
        Daniel Druet. They’d agreed on a price, and Cattelan would sign it and
        sell it for a much larger price later, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Druet ended up suing Cattelan, claiming this was a scam since he had
        built the piece with his own hands. Cattelan, on the other hand, argued
        that the ideas were his and that Druet was only following his
        instructions. At the heart of that battle was the notion of authorship
        in relation to <em>conceptualizing vs. making.</em> We can well see this
        in analogy with prompting: Who is the real artist? That who
        conceptualizes something, or that who makes/builds/writes/fixes the
        notes in a score? There is no clear-cut answer to that question, and
        potentially, artistship involves a bit of all. At least, I believe that.
        However, in the end, the French Tribunal verdict was against Druet,
        claiming that the true author of a work was who had the idea and had
        expressed it in words <em>–prompted?</em> and not who had executed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI, thus, becomes another tool to which we delegate part of the
        development of the work, as it has consistently happened throughout
        history. It doesn’t seem to interfere with the notion of authorship,
        even legally. Essentially, it doesn’t create anything new<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >It is important to clarify the use of new here and further on since
            it can be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, something new
            can be a new iteration of something coming into existence, for
            example, a new tool, which is ultimately a more recently assembled
            –or acquired– replica of an old tool. On the other hand, a new tool,
            as a newly conceived concept, element, or agent, is something that
            didn’t exist before until now. In this particular case, new is used
            in the later form. However, along the text, the interpretation of
            new should be inferred by the context.</span

        </span>
        –at least not yet. It recombines, regenerates, or reconstructs something
        –sometimes in astonishing ways– based on preexisting data with which
        these models are trained. But it does not create, and this is very
        observable, especially for an artist when he/she becomes more deeply
        engaged with these generative models.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans do have the capacity to create something new, even though a large
        extent of our creativity also comes from recombination or transformation
        of existing elements –as M. Boden largely discusses. Humans can come up
        with ideas out of the blue, whereas AI cannot. And this is important. AI
        is not creative at the level that humans can be, although it can
        seemingly imitate very well certain human capacities and certain types
        of human creative processes. AI depends on human-created data. There is
        no way around this, at least for now.
      </p>

      <h4>The real Versificator</h4>
      <p>
        OK. I’ve acknowledged that AI’s generative capabilities can help develop
        my creative ideas. It’s just another tool I utilize, manipulate, and
        ultimately take advantage of, but… There’s a big elephant in the room
        here. gen-AI is an era-changing technology. It deserves more than to be
        compared with <em>sampling,</em> with all my respect to that wonderful
        technique and wonderful craftsmen. While sampling is a very artisanal,
        time and energy-consuming process implemented almost entirely by human
        agency and hands –be it cutting/pasting tape or digital waveforms, and
        let alone the later processing and combining of these samples, gen-AI
        generates something almost automatically –even if it’s a recombination,
        redistribution or reconstruction of something that existed before– just
        by writing a prompt or pushing a button. And this is very important.
      </p>
      <p>
        One might say it merely generates, of course. It doesn’t create. But
        what will happen to music makers while AI becomes better and better, and
        more and more autonomic, to the point where there’s no need for any
        human creative agency at all? Neither for craftsmen nor idea-creators?
        What if these new artificial generators of music –or any other cultural
        good or piece of art, for that sake– become socially accepted
        “artists”?<span class="popover-container">

        Of course, AI models are not conscious entities. Therefore, there still
        must be a human behind them pressing the button. Maybe one person owns
        many. Not even taking creative credit but cashing the checks. Maybe a
        corporation owns all of them. What happens even when these tools are
        combined with powerful algorithms that learn from our choices and
        generate and provide us with just what we want? What happens when these
        are used by large companies to profit? An even more dystopic one: what
        if real artists could sell their voices to companies to make AI models
        of them? A piece of customizable music, specially fine-tuned for any
        audience’s taste.<span class="popover-container">

        I raised some of these questions before when composing the piece
        <em>Versificator – Render 3</em> back in 2020-2021 when Gen-AI didn’t
        exist yet in its current form. Of course, some of those inquiries feel
        very naïve now in 2024, in light of the new –hyperfast-paced–
        developments in gen-AI, such as ChatGPT-4o, Sora<span

        or even other more dystopic ones. I wonder how these inquiries will feel
        in 2026 or 2027. I have the feeling that a lot is going to change.
      </p>

      <h4><em>Derivative grey goo</em></h4>
      <p>
        Leaving the existential drama aside for a bit, I can discuss a little
        about what I see as aesthetic challenges of gen-AI as a tool for
        artists. Although at first glance, the results of experimenting with AI
        models in music might be interesting, overall, there’s the risk for
        these outputs to result in derivative and overly similar –poor– works.
        Martinus Suijkerbuijk has proposed a concept that feels somewhat right
        to me when referring to gen-AI-based art: the results of it potentially
        becomes a sort of derivative <em>grey goo.</em
        ><span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content"
            >I head these ideas for the first time in Martinus’ presentation at
            the SAR 2023 Conference “Too Early / Too Late” (April 19-21, 2023)
            in Trondheim, Norway. See
            <a href="https://sar2023.no/node/38" target="_blank"
              >https://sar2023.no/node/38</a
            >. Martinus’ idea of <em>grey goo</em> parallels with the scenario
            proposed by nanotechnology pioneer Eric Drexler. See
            <strong> Eric Drexler, </strong
            ><em> Engines of creation: the coming era of nanotechnology.</em>
            Anchor, 1987.</span
          ></span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though I am not a fully AI-based artist, in my practice, the
        problem of the derivative grey goo still demands a conscious design of
        strategies to produce some novelty and interest, but essentially, it
        demands aesthetic reflection and awareness. Whenever we are dealing with
        generative outcomes, the role of the artist, as I view it, becomes more
        and more involved also with curatorial practices –<em>curation</em> is
        understood here as a process of selection and organization of artistic
        material. In this sense, creating something using these tools becomes a
        sort of <em>latent</em>
        curatorial practice –and I will expand on this idea in the next
        paragraph. Essentially, some reflection, re-working, and refinement of
        this generative outcome might be beneficial. However, this –personal–
        approach doesn’t pretend to make other processes less valid or
        authentic.

        Chatonsky articulates a critical vision about some of the commonplaces

        the fear of replacement –which I experienced some paragraphs above, the
        need for state and supra-state regulation on AI-generated content, and
        many others. However, the point that I found most interesting is his
        vision of the latent space as a new cultural territory. In this new
        territory, art existed before it actually existed, it existed
        statistically or as a potentiality:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “The latent space is our new cultural space whose products are
          counterfactual. Angèle's song existed before it actually existed, it
          existed as a statistic or, depending on the case, a possibility. […]
          Everything exists before existing.”

            ><em>Tertiary retention,</em> a concept attributed to Bernard
            Stiegler, refers to memory that is exteriorized and inscribed in
            material forms, allowing for the transmission of knowledge across
            space and time, extending beyond the individual and specific
            cultural practices to form a lasting “reserve” in databases and

        and as these memories are feeding the large gen-AI models, these
        generate outcomes that have never occurred but, at the same time,
        resemble anything that might have been. Chatonsky proposes that we are
        now moving into a new era where AI represents the emergence of a
        quaternary memory, which relies on tertiary memories that have reached
        their peak of accumulation through the vast data of the World Wide Web.
        The latent space, thus, becomes the new space of artistic possibilities
        that contains the past but also the future and the incalculable:

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          If our culture, and its sharing, were determined by tertiary memories,
          the fruit of the industrial period, we are certainly entering a new
          era with quaternary memories where the aesthetic contract could be
          that of alienation: we reproduce machines that reproduce us. The
          latent space becomes a space of possibilities that contains the past
          but also, no doubt, a part of the future and the incalculable. […] it
          is now a question of statistical possibilities, which do not exist
          (yet).

        I believe that grasping this concept is essential for understanding the
        new practices currently emerging and set to become widespread soon. This
        shift will require us to reevaluate both the vision and the role of the
        artist, but also the notion of a work of art. As Chatonsky also
        discusses, these shiftings have occurred numerous times throughout
        history. As everything exists in the latent space, part of the work of
        an artist might involve thinking of him/herself as a curator of these
        latent potentialities. Is this something that has never happened in
        history before? Well, no.

          anthropotechnology, that is to say, the gray area that blurs the
          boundary between human beings and technology according to multiple
          threads. The earworm becomes statistical: in the wavering of this
          voice, human all too human, and which at one point laughs at the
          inhumanity of this reprise, we hear the way in which art is in no way
          the exteriorization of a human genius in a determined matter, form,
          and use, but is the misleading encounter with a matter whether it is
          technologically organized or not. The human being invents the
          technique, and, in the strict sense, Angèle is invented by a technique
          that clones her.

        To conclude this section, and to be completely honest, my view and
        approach to these issues are still evolving. The pace of advancement is
        overwhelming, and the changes are so rapid that it is hard to cement a
        vision of what things are or should be in relation to art, artists, and
        gen-AI. My reflections loop between the existential, the general, and
        the specific, back and forth, even when the issue arises directly from
        reflections on my very specific field of practice. The ethical, social,
        and economic implications of these escalate in magnitudes that I (we)
        cannot fully understand yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, reflecting on these issues has been crucial to developing an
        informed view and criteria that somehow guide my practice, my
        developments, and my artistic choices. I do believe, however, that
        ethical considerations around their use require permanent revision, as
        the development and application of gen-AI are moving extremely fast.
        These discussions are still relatively speculative and evolving at this
        very minute. Therefore, extensive research, collaboration, and open
        dialogue between practitioners –including artists, researchers,
        policymakers, and the general public– are crucial to developing a better
        understanding of what we are dealing with here.
