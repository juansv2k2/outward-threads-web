        This chapter examines two key aspects: the roots and historical context
        of my artistic practice, and the ethical considerations I regard as most
        significant in a compositional approach rooted in this tradition. The
        discussion addresses two primary concerns: the ethical dimensions of
        compositional practice within Western Art Contemporary Music and the
        ethical implications of using gen-AI in artistic creation. In the
        following section, I provide a detailed analysis of my field of
        practice, focusing first on its historical contextualization and then on
        the role of computers in the creative process, particularly in
        computer-assisted composition.

        The term <em>Contemporary Music</em> or <em>New Music</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >In general, the terms Contemporary Music and New Music can be –and
            are usually– used indistinctively, although some authors use this
            different conceptualization to establish a categorical clear
            difference between them. See for example
            <strong>Joan Arnau Pamies, </strong>"New Music Is Not (Necessarily)

        conventionally refers to a wide range of compositional and performative
        artistic musical practices that emerged in Western cultural centers
        after the Second World War, during the latter half of the 20th century,
        and continue into the 21st century. To clarify, I use the term Western
        Art Contemporary Music (WACM) to define these practices specifically.
      </p>

      <p>
        WACM is characterized as a type of critical and self-reflexive music
        that seeks to challenge, expand, or break away from the traditional
        stylistic and aesthetic norms of earlier musical traditions. Initially,
        the philosophical foundations of contemporary music were deeply rooted
        in the ideas of modernity.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            ><em>Modernity,</em> in its conventional understanding, refers to a
            global movement emerging in the early twentieth century, that sought
            to align society and culture with the experiences of modern
            industrial life. Some of the most important principles of modernist
            art included a rejection of historical artistic values –which were
            viewed as conservative or bourgeois– and an interest in innovation
            and experimentation, putting the focus on materials and processes.
            Modernism was often driven by utopian social and political agendas,
            embodying idealized visions of progress. Around the 1960s, the
            subsequent rise of post-modernism marked a reaction against
            modernist ideals and methodologies. In

        Some early contemporary music practitioners drew influence from thinkers
        such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Ludwig Wittgenstein, with Theodor Adorno
        arguably being one of the most significant and influential figures in
        this regard.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >See for example <strong>Adorno, </strong>Aesthetic Theory;
            <strong> Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, </strong
            ><em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> (Stanford University Press,
            2007); <strong>Adorno, </strong

        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        After World War II, some European and American composers, influenced by
        modernist ideals, sought to break with tradition to redefine music.
        Early figures like Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Boulez, and Milton
        Babbitt explored compositional methods by blending mathematical and
        abstract formulations with music theory and organization to create new
        compositions. Soon after, this scientificist approach led to music
        becoming hypercomplex and disconnected from the interest of broader
        audiences. Despite this, some composers defended it as a cornerstone of
        WACM, viewing it as a mission to elevate music to a higher state of
        development.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >See for example <strong>Milton Babbitt, </strong>"Who cares if you
            listen?," <em> High Fidelity </em> 8, no. 2 (1958).</span
          >
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        After a few years of severe criticism of the dehumanized results of some
        <em>avant-garde</em> experiments,<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >See for example <strong>Iannis Xenakis, </strong>"La crise de la
            musique sérielle," 1, no. 1 (1955).</span
          ></span
        >
        composers shifted toward more personal styles, leading to a
        diversification of aesthetics described by Leonard Meyer as a period of
        <em>stasis</em> by the 1960s.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"

            ><em>

              twentieth-century culture,

            (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1967).</span
          ></span
        >
        Later generations of composers adopted a more inclusive attitude toward
        both tradition and popular music, deviating from some of the negational
        stanzas of modernism. They favored a pluralistic approach, drawing from
        diverse musical genres and celebrating the fusion of styles and the
        deconstruction of established WACM conventions, for example, by
        exploring non-Western music, cultural narratives, and rituals. Some
        theorists refer to these composers as <em>postmodernists.</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >Some theorists view musical postmodernism as a dialogue with,
            rather than a rejection of, modernism, reflecting and critiquing its
            ideals while coexisting with them. For example,
            <strong>David Metzer,</strong>
            <em> Musical Modernism at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century </em
            >(Cambridge University Press, 2011).</span

        These fragmentations and interplay between philosophical perspectives
        have undergone various shifts in dominance, influencing the focus and
        shaping the preferences of those curating WACM concerts and festivals.
        For example, we have witnessed the rise of the “New Complexity”
        movement, featuring composers such as Brian Ferneyhough and others, as
        well as subsequent responses to it, including movements toward
        “Neo-Tonalism” and the reactions that followed. These alternating trends
        potentially persist into and beyond what has been termed “Late
        Modernity,” a period I will elaborate on in the section ‘Field of
        Practice.’ But before delving into that, I want to address some specific
        ethical concerns I have around a compositional practice rooted in WACM
        as it has unfolded thus far. Some of these ideas, even though they have
        been fiercely discussed in the past, still somehow spill into our
        current day.

      <h4>Ethics of a Compositional Practice</h4>

      <p>
        In his lecture “Music is Toxic,” Dmitri Kourliandsky examines parallels
        between music and political systems, suggesting that music is a
        reflection of societal hierarchies and power dynamics.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            ><strong>Dmitri Kourliandsky, </strong>“Music is Toxic,” lecture at
            the Festival and Academy for Composers "Impuls," 2023. In addition,
            some of the main topics addressed by him in this lecture are also
            present in this video: <strong>Kourliandsky, </strong>"Author VS
            Avatar [Video]."
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jLSPJIAhws&ab_channel=DmitriKourliandski</span
          ></span
        >
        Using models like “tonal feudalism” and “twelve-tone democracy,” he
        illustrates the political nature of musical revolutions and
        counterrevolutions. Kourliandsky also emphasizes the role of music
        composition as a societal act, urging composers to view our work as a
        mirror of political realities and to engage with the inherently
        political nature of creating music.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I understand them, his reflections are mainly aimed at raising
        awareness among young –and not-so-young– composers about the importance
        of the act of composing: music and the act of composing are socially
        relevant, and composers should seriously engage with these reflections,
        understanding composition as a fundamentally political act. I completely
        agree with his idea so far. However, there’s something unsettling about
        Kourliandsky’s talk: It seems to primarily address composers of WACM at
        one of the largest mainstream festivals, located in one of the
        wealthiest European countries, which allocates a significant budget to
        sustain these practices –a situation mirrored in much of Europe. In this
        context, I believe his main thesis encounters some resistance.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has often been observed that much of WACM –as commonly understood in
        the context of Kourliandsky’s lecture– frequently operates as a
        divergent practice with limited resonance within broader society.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >Of course, it is easy to be divergent when your life situation does
            not face significant risks, such as economic pressure or political
            persecution—circumstances that are the fortunate reality for many
            Western-European young composers but do not replicate globally. This
            is a personal idea I have held for a long time, and I was pleased to
            hear it echoed by <strong>Pier Luigi Sacco </strong>in his keynote
            speech at the SAR Conference 2023, titled “Too Early / Too Late.”
            The full speech can be found here:

        Why might this be the case? Could it be that these tendencies stem from
        historical directives that encouraged a deliberate distancing from
        tradition, popular musical, and societal norms? If so, I wonder how
        these historical legacies continue to shape the ways WACM practitioners
        position our work today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite a long history of politically engaged and activist experimental
        and avant-garde music practitioners –figures like Luigi Nono, Pauline
        Oliveros, George Crumb, Cornelius Cardew, and George Lewis, among many
        others– I find myself questioning whether much of the music produced
        today, particularly by the composers Kourliandsky appears to address,
        genuinely reflects the issues he suggests it does. Probably, it’s easier
        to observe how Kourliandsky’s ideas potentially manifest in certain
        styles of popular music, for example, where lyrics, choreography, and
        visual elements –such as those in music videos– advocate violence or
        oppression, particularly against women.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >The clearest and most massive example for me is reggaeton, a dance
            genre originated in Panama in the 1980s that has become massive in
            Latin America starting in the early 2000s. In most cases, reggaeton
            has explicit lyrics that apologize for the use of drugs, violence,
            disposable love and sex.</span
          ></span
        >
        Creators and listeners of such music share responsibility for producing
        and consuming content that perpetuates these issues. However, when it
        comes to WACM, things are almost always
        <em>up in the air.</em> Historically, WACM has been viewed as seeking
        some form of social advancement,<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >It is true that, even for avant-garde practitioners, the idea of
            music’s capacity for social advancement was somewhat limited.
            Adorno, for example, mainly saw this music as a critique of the
            capitalist culture industry, which he argued reduced art to a
            commodity for mass consumption. In contrast, the avant-garde
            rejected conventional musical forms, tonality, and harmony, creating
            tensions and contradictions that inherently reflected modern
            society. While Adorno recognized the potential of avant-garde music
            to provoke critical thought about social conditions, he was
            skeptical about its ability to directly influence social change.
            Rather, its transformative power was more intellectual than
            revolutionary. See <strong>Adorno, </strong
            ><em>Aesthetic Theory; </em><strong>Adorno, </strong
            ><em> Philosophy of New Music; </em>
            <strong>Adorno and Horkheimer, </strong
            ><em> Dialectic of Enlightement. </em></span
          ></span
        >
        and it is within this perceived goal that the contradiction lies, as I
        see it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, this is a deeply personal perspective, and I recognize that
        others may strongly challenge it. However, I wonder: Is this perception
        a reflection of a broader disconnect between the stated intentions of
        WACM practitioners and the actual resonance of our work? Could it stem
        from changes in how political engagement is expressed in music today?
        Maybe the political or activist potential of contemporary composers has
        taken on subtler or less overtly recognizable forms?
      </p>

      <p>
        In considering how an artistic practice rooted in WACM might truly
        reflect the issues Kourliandsky discusses regarding the act of
        composing, I believe that practitioners should potentially critically
        examine two important ethical concerns inherited from past traditions:
        the idea of <em>seclusion</em> and the notion of
        <em>epistemological colonialism,</em> and how these aspects might still
        influence the ethical implications surrounding our practices today.
        Furthermore, given that WACM is often supported through public funding,
        these issues call also for a deeper reflection on the relationship
        between public resources and the music produced, and what
        responsibilities, if any, composers and practitioners have in ensuring
        that our work resonates with or engage the public that sustains it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Concerning the theme of seclusion, I find myself reflecting on the
        potential risks of social and artistic isolation tied to certain
        historical directives in the practice of WACM. Specifically, the
        lingering influence of discourses that elevate formal and material
        complexity, as well as the pursuit of an “academic” or “serious” status,
        as primary measures of artistic value and prestige. While these ideas
        were critically examined and debated –sometimes quite harshly– in the
        late 1980s<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >See for example <strong>Susan McClary, </strong>"Terminal Prestige:
            The Case of Avant-Garde Music Composition,"
            <em>Cultural Critique, </em>no. 12 (1989).</span
          >
        </span>
        and beyond, I wonder whether the paradox of WACM’s relationship with
        accessibility and complexity has truly been resolved. This is not a
        novel observation, but it remains an important one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Might the excessive pursuit of complexity inadvertently lead to works
        that struggle to communicate their conceptual depth? Could this tendency
        create a gap between the music and its audience, especially for
        listeners without formal training, who may dismiss such works as
        “random” or incomprehensible? Does this alienation risk fostering a
        perception among audiences that they are unprepared –or even “not smart
        enough”– to engage with what is presented as a high art form?
      </p>

      <p>
        This disconnection –whether intentional or unconscious– often positions
        practitioners apart from the societies that financially support our work
        through public funding. I wonder whether this distance holds inherent
        value or if it risks alienating audiences who might otherwise engage
        more deeply with these practices. Could a conscious and ongoing
        reevaluation of the relationship between WACM and its audiences open
        pathways to practices that are more socially resonant? And what role
        should we, as practitioners, play in addressing such questions?
      </p>

      <p>
        These are reflections that are very present in me and possibly have a
        strong impact on my work. This is not to say my music is simple, or easy
        to listen to. Quite on the contrary. However, I do not wish that the
        <em>value</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >The value of an artistic element is imprecisely defined by a large
            and complex network of external factors that it is not the scope of
            this project to identify and disentangle. However, I find
            interesting some of the discussions regarding the concept of value
            of art and creative practice in <strong>Boden, </strong
            ><em> The creative mind: myths and mechanisms. </em></span
          >
        </span>
        of my work to derive from the approval of a specific ideal listener or
        from conforming to narrow frameworks of validation by highly educated or
        musically trained audiences. In this sense, I wonder: Can we envision a
        concept of value in WACM that resonates more broadly with audiences,
        fostering an inclusive and expansive artistic dialogue?
      </p>

      <p>
        The second issue I observe arises from the significant infusion of
        financial, technological resources, and <em>social capital</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            ><strong>Pierre Bourdieu, </strong>"The field of cultural
            production," <em>Poetics</em> 12 (1983),

        into Western central countries following World War II, which propagated
        WACM ideas, techniques, and philosophical debates, establishing them as
        the norm for composers on the periphery. This has historically
        positioned Western central countries as both creators and arbiters of
        the standards that define legitimate and worthy contemporary music.
      </p>

      <p>
        This influence has left a lasting impact on composition pedagogy and
        educational frameworks worldwide, an effect that, I believe, continues
        to persist. Some authors have described this paradigm as a longstanding
        manifestation of European colonialism, perpetuating certain ontologies
        and epistemological views.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >Wallerstein, along with the four volumes of his book
            <em>The Modern World System</em> (1970-2011) proposes that the
            history of the modern world can be viewed as the history of the
            expansion of European states and their institutions into the rest of
            the world. Of course, the modernity that colonialism generated has
            certainly changed in postmodern times, but certain aspects of
            colonial epistemology and ontology continue to persist, influencing
            how the periphery understands the world and how it lives in ways
            that still reflect colonial legacies. In this line, even though the
            European colonialist project officially ended with the national

        In the case of WACM, such hegemony many times has shared the venue with

        To what extent might colonial ideas, consciously or unconsciously, still
        persist within WACM institutions and even among practitioners
        themselves? How might these problems be addressed?

        The late 1990s and early 2000s indeed marked significant shifts in
        Western cultural, artistic, and musical institutions, characterized by
        increasing emphasis on participation, inclusion, and diversity.<span

        This openness allowed a broader range of styles, approaches, and
        practitioners to enter WACM stages, a trend that is observable in many
        festivals and other related institutions. Could this evolution represent
        a new form of stasis –one distinct from Meyer’s concept– where diversity
        in participants and origins, rather than just techniques and styles,
        becomes the defining characteristic? In this sense, a valid ethical
        concern for a practice rooted in WACM could be how music strives to be
        inclusive of a diverse audience and a range of musical influences and
        how the emphasis on diversity is not merely symbolic but transformative.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some practitioners, this inclusivity might take diverse forms, but
        for me, it relates to my own experience as a musician engaged with
        various popular musical genres. Setting aside the more complex issue of
        <em>cultural appropriation,</em
        ><span class="popover-container"

            >Some discussion around it can be found on

        an essential aspect of WACM practice could be to embrace –rather than
        exclude– these varied musical experiences. Such inclusion might foster
        richer engagement with artistic questions across cultural perspectives
        and narratives.<span class="popover-container"

        How can WACM practitioners navigate this inclusivity while maintaining
        authenticity? And to what extent can embracing diverse influences shape
        a more equitable and dynamic field of practice?
      </p>
      <p>
        It is fair to say that, in my practice, and especially within this
        project, one should not expect to find overt references to popular
        traditions. Why is that? While I have been involved in numerous projects
        across different musical styles, I don’t strongly identify with any
        specific popular genre.<span

            However, in the past, I have been actively involved as a pianist and
            arranger for Argentine Tango. You can listen to some recordings from
            the orchestra "Sanluistango," with whom I collaborated from 2016 to
            2019:

              >https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/artist/5NUcvoOqMcjF4wiaC2ywNq</a
            >. In addition, some of my past experimental music projects employed
            Argentinean and Latin American folk elements. See for example,
            'Vidala para mi Sombra' (J.S. Espinza) by 'Azul 514':
            <a
              href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/track/2EBugfwyvi5BcmFyS8NHl2"
              >https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/track/2EBugfwyvi5BcmFyS8NHl2</a
            >
          </span>
        </span>
        I’m concerned that my use of these traditions might risk becoming
        decontextualized, superficial, or lacking in meaning, in particular
        within the scope of this research. However, I believe these narratives
        still play a role in my creative process, even if their influence isn’t
        immediately apparent in the music. They shape me on an unconscious
        level. Admittedly, the presence of these influences in my current
        practice remains more speculative –or simply a matter of intention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following that line, I believe that a potential issue for a WACM
        composer to reflect upon could be whether to consider how the progress
        of other musical genres relates to WACM, and how techniques, and
        advancements from fields such as popular music production, audiovisual
        production, and other forms of technology might be more progressive
        –potentially more so than some longstanding techniques in WACM.
        Moreover, how might these elements be integrated into a creative
        practice that aspires to sustain itself by reaching a wider
        audience?<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >An interesting example that has made me reflect on this is the work
            of Gabriel Prokofiev, combining DJing, turntables, and contemporary
            composition techniques. See

        The relationship between WACM and public funding has been –and continues
        to be– a highly debated issue. Personally, I have no objection to
        musical practices that avoid commercialization as a means of support and
        sustenance. However, if a creative practice relies on public funding
        because it cannot sustain itself, and practitioners choose to dismiss or
        undervalue the intellectual, educational, or aesthetic preferences of
        the wider public, we risk being perceived as irrelevant or, worse,
        unnecessary. Such a perception could significantly harm experimental or
        research-based musical practices by jeopardizing their support. Instead,
        composers might benefit from reflecting on the broader implications of
        how and why our work is supported by society. How can WACM composers
        balance innovation with societal engagement? How can experimental music
        ensure it maintains both artistic relevance and public support?
      </p>
      <p>
        To conclude, I hope these reflections –however brief and subjective–
        help highlight some important ethical questions that I believe persist
        within WACM. I firmly believe the social impact of an artistic
        compositional practice should never be dismissed, provided we, as
        composers, recognize the significance of our role and take
        responsibility for it. This process begins by asking ourselves
        meaningful questions –perhaps some of those I’ve raised here, or others,
        as my perspective is neither objective nor exhaustive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Personally, I strive for my music to remain conscious of contemporary
        social challenges and to foster dialogue about musical, artistic,
        political, and ethical issues. I hope this awareness inspires similar
        questioning in other practitioners, especially younger ones. Throughout
        my research, I have made a conscious effort to address these concerns in
        my artistic and educational work. I believe these ethical discussions
        remain vital today and are essential for the future development of the
        field.
