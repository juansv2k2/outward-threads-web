            Is it possible for a composer to create music solely from intuitive
            impulses? Is it possible for one to truly abandon all rules and just
            let creativity flow from the gut? And if one does, is this a
            genuinely creative process or merely the production of an
            uncontrolled stream of familiar patterns that the composer has
            absorbed throughout study, influences of music making and listening?
            Patterns that, as comfortable as they are, don’t challenge any
            norms?

              I hear these musicians who play incredibly fast, accurately, and
              expressively without even thinking. It’s so inspiring! Yet,
              sometimes so predictable after a couple of songs… How to feel
              about these trends in music education that encourage “intuitive”
              practices? –because it’s all about <em>intuition…</em> maybe it’s
              all about what fits commercial demands or popular taste.
            </p>
            <em>
              <p>Is that wrong?</p>
            </em>
            <p>
              I mean… even academic and institutionalized tastes can –and often
              do– push this normativity. I hear a lot of new music nowadays that
              still has that <em>good-old</em> IRCAM sound. Even some music that
              still sounds like Darmstadt in the 60s. Mine sometimes does. Not
              that I want it, it’s just there, over my shoulders.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is this not a manifestation of the same compositional
              <em>recombinancy</em>
              paradigm, pretty much as using ChatGPT? We now see artistic
              statements, abstracts, and even entire articles generated by
              ChatGPT. It has such a strong dialect that one can almost read it
              from a kilometer away. Are we genuinely uncovering new
              “tapestries” or “intricacies”? Are we truly making the world a
              more creative or even democratic place?
            </p>
            <p>Is this good for the coming newer generations?</p>

              Shall I keep writing complex rules, hoping that I will get some
              musical ideas worth the time it took me to code them? Complex and
              <em>thought-through</em> music… is progressive? How is that more
              progressive and experimental than the subtle and perfect rhythmic
              variations of a bombisto playing <em>Chacarera</em

                  Chacarera is an Argentinean folk species typical from the

            <p>Am I losing my <em>edge?</em></p>
            <p>
              I believe I slowly drifted away from the point of these
              reflections…
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe there is something good in exploring the nuances of
              AI-driven creativity in discovering new possibilities with prompts
              and gen-AI. Maybe <em>that</em> is progressive. Is it not what
              everyone is doing nowadays? Then, it’s normative. Normative vs.
              Non-normative…

            <em>
              <p>Who cares?</p>

            <p>
              What does it mean to train a neural network on some music, press a
              bang, get a result, and claim it as my composition? Is it art?
              Even if it takes me forever to code, implement, and make the whole
              thing work? Even if I write fancy articles about it? Where is my
              agency in the process? Is it in the choice of the dataset? Is it
              in cherry-picking the outcome?
            </p>
            <p>
              Is writing code rules art? Is art the result of the rules? Is it
              the result of the selection? Is it the result of the engraving? Is
              it how it looks in the score? Is it how it sounds? Is it what it
              says?
            </p>
            <p>Is it what others say about it?</p>
            <p>Is art an experience, regardless of who or what made it?</p>
            <p>But then, is nature art?</p>
            <p>Ok. I have spent too much time in my office now.</p>
