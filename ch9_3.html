      <h3>Perspectives for the future</h3>

      <p>
        This project has now concluded. While the artistic outcomes have been
        presented and the accompanying reflections are essentially complete,
        lingering questions remain, and new opportunities have emerged that I
        see as worth exploring. To continue unraveling some of these
        <em>outward threads</em> in a future project, I believe the ideas
        outlined in the later stages of the project suggest a promising
        direction for further research. This involves creatively investigating
        and developing technological tools in conjunction with AI to discover
        new forms of artistic expression, emphasizing the need to reshape ideas
        about music, art, the artist, materials, and many other aspects that are
        rapidly evolving. I believe this is critically important, as we find
        ourselves in a pivotal period of human history regarding the development
        of artificial intelligence, making this endeavor feel less like merely
        "working on what you love" and more like a mission that must be pursued.
