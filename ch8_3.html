      <h3>Field of Practice</h3>
      <p>
        Let me briefly return to the discussion of modernism versus
        postmodernism. While I cannot definitively situate my music within the
        framework of postmodernism, I believe it both incorporates and rejects
        aspects of modernity and postmodernity alike. Additionally, I have yet
        to encounter terminology that satisfactorily captures contemporary
        artistic practices that extend beyond postmodernism,<span

            (Newcastle, UK: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2013). . However, an
            interpretation of this critique into contemporary musical practices
            as those I have referred as WACM or CAC exceeds me.</span

      <p>
        I would like to rescue the term “Late Modernity” or “Second Modernity”,
        proposed by C. S. Mahnkopf and other authors.<span

        It is used to define a type of compositional practice that has been
        learned from classical modernity, avant-garde, and also from
        postmodernity. It questions the postmodern conviction that creating new,
        innovative musical content is no longer possible, or that all materials,
        regardless of context, are equally valid for use. In this sense, it
        advocates for cohesive and coherent styles, utilizing elements that are
        recent developments. It doesn’t just oppose postmodernism; it also
        aligns positively with the principles of classical modernism in the
        necessity for technical construction in music.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most important characteristic of Late Modernism, according to
        Mahnkopf, is the striving to create multi-perspectival or
        non-reductionistic works. In this sense, Mahnkopf argues that the three
        dimensions of differentiation examined by Lehmann<span
          class="popover-container"
        >
          *<span class="popover-content"

            <strong>Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf, </strong

          >
        </span>
        –work, medium, and reflection– no longer form a unity, and it is
        expected that each dimension can gain partial dominance depending on
        emphasis, intention, tradition, and taste. This is essential to me, as I
        believe a complete appreciation of my works is closely tied to
        understanding their foundational concept or genesis –though not
        necessarily the constructive process.
      </p>

      <p>
        Potentially, the ideas of Late Modernism are somewhat close to mine, as
        I believe there needs to be a conciliation between what Mahnkopf
        describes as the forces of innovation and experimentation and the
        conviction that construction, and some technical validation of the
        musical discourse, is indispensable. In addition, some pieces by
        composers labeled as
        <em>late-modernists</em> are on my list of favorites and have largely
        influenced me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mahnkopf wrote in 2011 that Late Modernity is still in the process of
        <em>becoming</em>.<span class="popover-container">

        Considering the pace at which current society is moving in terms of
        technological advancements, geopolitical conflicts, and destruction of
        the environment, discussing the affinity of my work to an aesthetical
        category that was coined around the first decade of the 2000s might seem
        outdated or uninformed. However, and this comes from my direct personal
        observation –some might well disagree on it– the ideas of Late Modernity
        are still well-suited to encompass the large part of the practices
        hosted by the mainstream European and Western contemporary music
        festivals.<span class="popover-container">

      </p>

      <p>
        Here are a few examples of late modern works and composers that have
        influenced me:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          George Haas – <em>Saxophonequartett</em> for saxophone quartet (2014).
          From this piece, I value the use of isochrony that gradually breaks
          apart. I believe it largely influenced my rhythmic ideas and processes
          of temporal development. Also, I find interesting the use of
          microtonality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rebecca Saunders – <em>Solitude</em> for solo cello (2013). In this
          piece, I appreciated how a scordatura C string can re-tint the natural
          grain of the cello, creating shadowy, isolated low-register drones
          intertwined with double-stopped melodic fragments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chaya Czernowin – <em>Hidden</em> for string quartet and electronics
          (2013-2014). From this piece, I find fascinating the perfect
          amalgamation between the string quartet and the electronics. Also, I
          found really interesting its notation aspects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Malin Bång – <em>Splinters of ebullient rebellion</em> for orchestra
          (2018). This composition reflects on the dynamic interplay between
          individual and collective forces in society and the orchestra,
          incorporating symbolic elements such as fragments of democratic
          anthems, the voices of orchestral members, and the typewriter to
          explore themes of political idealism, resistance, and the
          transformative power of individual actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dániel Péter Biró – <em>Al Ken Kara</em> for 7 voices (2015). This
          work provided me with several aspects that sparked some of my key
          mature compositional ideas. In particular, the exploration of
          compositional relationships between music and language, the
          translation of texts into the sonorous domain, the structural
          relationships between text and music, and the use of language as both
          concrete phonetic material and sonic expression. Additionally, the
          piece sparked some early reflections on the relevance of composition
          as a means to convey a message of diversity and tolerance.<span
            class="popover-container"
          >
            *<span class="popover-content"
              >In <em>Al Ken Kara,</em> The myth of Babel is examined both in
              historical and contemporary contexts, linking the dispersal of
              humanity to our globalized, multilingual existence today. This is
              reconstructed from an ancient language and its evolving modes of
              cantillation, which have developed over time. See the chapter "The
              Sound of the Voice is the Name of the Place" by

      <h4>Post-contemporary?</h4>
      <p>
        Is it possible that by 2024, Late Modernity has already been surpassed
        by something else? I cannot say for sure, but most likely, yes.
        Observing recent practices of composers aged 30 to 50, it seems
        plausible that we are witnessing the emergence of some form of
        <em>post-late-modernism:</em> a movement where late-modernist musical
        ideas have evolved into something distinct. As a speculative exercise, I
        propose a list of currently very active composers and works that have
        profoundly impacted me by suggesting something genuinely new, perhaps
        ideas or sounds I had never previously imagined. Sometimes, these works
        are connected with recent technological developments, though not always.
        This, ultimately, represents the musical space I aspire for my work to
        inhabit (I recognize this is more a reflection of my aspirations than an
        objective reality).
      </p>

      <p>
        Very short list of example pieces that I would fit in my idea of
        <em>post-contemporary</em>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Only Slime – <em>Afterlife</em> (2023): <em>Afterlife</em> is a
          computer game opera by the duo Only Slime, performed by two players in
          a staged setting using motion capture to control avatars in a
          3D-projected game universe. The opera explores themes of death and the
          afterlife through traditional gaming storytelling devices like
          scripted sequences, cutscenes, and respawning, presenting immersive
          simulation as an allegorical model for life, death, reincarnation, and
          consciousness.<span class="popover-container">

          Rylander, Åberg, Jalhed – <em>The prophecies</em> (micro-opera)
          (2023): The artwork reflects a facet of opera in connection with new
          technology, particularly gen-AI and contemporary operatic displays,
          including video and pop-techno music.<span class="popover-container">

          The central principle of <em>Systema Naturae</em> is to establish and
          explore a middle ground where mechanized objects are controlled in a
          musical manner, allowing for the creation of events, spectral
          exploration, and dynamic organization, while traditional musical
          instruments are approached in an object-like manner through extensive
          use of extended techniques.<span class="popover-container"

          work transforms two singers into hybrid beings by placing small
          speakers inside their mouths. The “voice,” consisting of electronic
          tones, noise, and clicks, is produced through this bodily extension,
          while the performers physical voices remain entirely unused throughout
          the three short studies.<span class="popover-container">

        <li>
          Johann Svensson – <em>Stop Motion</em> (2018): This piece combines
          acoustic instruments such as percussionist and ensemble with
          electro-mechanical devices and lights. The work is inspired by the
          animation technique of stop motion.

      </ul>

      <h4>Computer-Assisted Composition</h4>
      <p>
        M. Puckette proposes that, currently, there are two approaches to
        musical creation using computers: One concerned with the synthesis and
        manipulation of musical sounds and the other concerned with symbolic
        representations of music. The two branches have been named “Computer
        Generated Music” (CGM) and “Computer Aided/Assisted Composition”
        (CAC).<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content"
            >The term <em>computer-assisted</em> composition sometimes is
            referred as <em>computer-aided</em> composition by some
            authors.</span
          ></span
        >
        CAC centers on the creation of music using symbolic forms like standard
        notation. Within CAC, the tradition of representing music symbolically
        is predominantly envisioned for acoustic instruments associated with the
        classical or contemporary instrumental tradition, which are expected to
        execute the composed piece.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            ><strong>Puckette, M. </strong>in

            ><em> The OM Composer's Book </em>(Ircam, Centre Pompidou,
            2016).</span
          ></span
        >
        Some historically relevant composers in the new paradigm of CAC are
        Kaija Saariaho, Clarence Barlow, Magnus Lindberg, Jean-Claude Risset,
        and Ivan Fedele.<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content"
            >For an in-depth historical review of the origin and historical
            development of CAC, see <strong>Haas, </strong>"The language of the
            assistant and the language of the creator: selected aspects of
            computer assisted composition." ;
            <strong>Karlheinz Essl, </strong>"Algorithmic composition," in
            <em>Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music,</em> ed. Nick Collins
            and Julio d'Escrivan (Cambridge University Press, 2007).
          </span></span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        In the current era, this workflow is facilitated by CAC programs, mainly
        featuring object-oriented visual programming environments. These systems
        foster an environment where the boundaries between conventional music
        representation and programming language blur. As a result, in the realm
        of modern CAC, differentiating between “programming” and “composing” as
        distinct, sequential tasks is no longer feasible: they have become
        entwined in the creative process. In this context, the concept for a
        piece often emerges through an interactive process with the machine,
        allowing for real-time verification and adjustment of the musical
        trajectories. Throughout the composition process, it’s possible to view
        intermediate or alternate outcomes in various formats, from traditional
        music notation to audible playback.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, there is a very active and dynamic global scene of
        contemporary composers engaging with CGM and CAC –practices that are
        often quite intertwined. In recent years, I have actively engaged with
        members of two collectives of practitioners that I believe are highly
        relevant and active and potentially the most significant in the field
        related to my project. These are the groups PRISMA and ARIGA.
      </p>

      <h5>PRISMA</h5>
      <p>
        In 2001, the composer Jacopo Baboni-Schilingi<span
          class="popover-container"
        >
          *<span class="popover-content"
            >Jacopo Baboni-Schilingi defined his compositional praxis around the
            year 2003-2007 as <em>hypersystemic music:</em> an approach that
            involves an array of compositional systems mediated by CAC. These
            systems are governed by a unifying theory that accounts for their
            poetic, practical, and artistic aspects. See
            <strong>Baboni Schilingi,</strong>

        established a music research collective called PRISMA at the Tempo Reale
        Centre in Florence, focusing on the pedagogy and international research
        of computer-assisted musical systems. The group’s goal is to produce
        music that is grounded in complex formal methodologies while remaining
        emotionally resonant, embodying the ideal of creating music that is both
        intellectually conceived and emotionally felt. The project PRISMA
        encompasses five key areas: research, diffusion, production, promotion,
        and education.<span class="popover-container">

      <p>Recommended works (very short list):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          J. B. Schillingi – <em>Nox</em> (2003-2015) for two singers and live
          computer. <em>Nox</em> is a cycle of four compositions for two singers
          and live electronics, inspired by the night and the gradual
          disappearance of matter, with texts drawn from the Latin version of
          Ecclesiastes; each piece explores the interplay of vocal techniques
          and electronic sound, culminating in a new virtuosity that merges
          voice and machine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Magnus Lindberg – <em>Engine</em> (1996) for symphonic orchestra. This
          piece is inspired by the computing language used in the PatchWork CAC
          environment, where the composer sets constraints for the computer to
          generate musical material.
        </li>
        <li>
          Örjan Sandred – <em>Engrams</em> (2020) for saxophone quartet and live
          electronics. This piece explores memory and transformation in music,
          beginning with a forceful ending whose impact lingers and fades
          throughout the piece, utilizing quartertone harmony,
          performer-responsive electronics, and synthesized sounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hans Tutschku – <em>Sparks</em> (2021) for piano and live electronics.
          The piece explores a dynamic relationship between piano and live
          electronics through a blend of precise notation and interpretative
          freedom, enabling real-time interaction where the pianist and
          electronics influence each other in an immersive dialogue.

          Julien Vincenot – <em>Silent_data_corrupt</em> (2014) for alto
          saxophone and electronics. This work explores the metaphor of data
          corruption and memory loss, navigating between strict notation and
          improvisation, reflecting on the fragility and overwhelming
          accumulation of information.

        ARIGA addresses artistic research that focuses on the computational, the
        algorithmic, and the generative. Computation is understood as an actor
        integrated into a mesh of irreducible interrelations, part of an ecology
        in which technological, historical, social, and scientific aspects
        diffract. ARIGA critically addresses fundamental questions common to
        diverse practices and seeks to gather artist-researchers working with
        generative processes in heterogeneous media, including space, sound,
        image, video, sculpture, and language.
