      <h3>Final Reflections</h3>

      <p>
        In this section, I described several methods for creating musical
        narratives through the abstraction and translation of information across
        domains. I discussed the human ability for abstraction, emphasizing how
        we naturally detect and unify patterns across sensory modalities as a
        fundamental capacity for development and learning. Abstraction, by
        integrating multisensory information, goes beyond the three cognitive
        paradigms previously discussed. Therefore, I understand that creative
        processes concerned with abstraction are essential for deepening and
        creatively exploring the symbolic, connectionist, and embodied
        dimensions of cognition.

        Compared to humans, computers are relatively limited to unimodal
        representation of patterns. Therefore, the capacity for abstraction
        –particularly its role at the core of what we understand as art– places
        unidimensional computational formalizations significantly behind human
        artistic capabilities. This limitation becomes especially evident when
        creative processes rely solely on such approaches. On the other hand,
        technological advancements have enabled the translation of vast amounts
        of data across domains and modalities. One important creative method
        arising from this is sonification, made possible through these new
        technologies. Sonification has a long history and has been developed by
        numerous composers over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the composition of the piece <em>I am a Strange Loop,</em> I relied
        on processes of abstraction, such as symbolic sonification,
        audification, and parametrical remapping, to create a musical narrative.
        The piece mainly emerges from the formalization of preexisting musical
        information into new musical material and structures. Formal systems and
        aspects related to symbolic cognition emerge on objective processes of
        translation and structural organization, while other heuristic
        strategies related to intuition and embodiment emerge when seeking
        particular sonorities, timbral qualities, or sonic worlds outside those
        formalizable ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, I should note that this piece and its constructive aspects are
        not intended to supersede previous works or represent a higher degree of
        evolution or refinement. Rather, the discussion in this section aims to
        illustrate how some of these more abstract processes operate at the
        compositional level, offering a potential alternative and serving as a
        more detailed case study of the emergence and interplay of the three
        cognitive paradigms discussed earlier. This last point will be explored
        further in the ‘Conclusions?’ section.

            This concludes the discussion on the artistic outcome of the
            project. What follows transitions into a more personal and
            introspective reflection.
