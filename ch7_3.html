      <h3>I am a Strange Loop</h3>

      <p>
        A <em>strange loop</em> can be seen as a form of recursion that creates
        a sense of infinity.<span class="popover-container"

        The term <em>recursion</em> here is important. It originates in computer
        sciences and consists of a programming technique where a function calls
        itself to solve a problem. In addition, this concept has been adopted to
        describe elements that appear repeated in self-similar ways. For
        example, in nature, recursive structures are found in crystals and
        plants.<span class="popover-container"

        In music, the concepts of recursion and self-similarity have given rise
        to vast investigations and the development of diverse compositional
        applications for them. Even though there are many approaches to music
        composition using these notions, most authors relate this idea to
        techniques of counterpoint. In particular, those that have their origin
        in the <em>prolatio</em> canon, which depends mainly on the simultaneous
        rendition of the same theme at various temporal scales. Early examples
        of these techniques can be found in works by the Renaissance composer
        Johannes Ockeghem and more recurrently in the music of Josquin Des Prez.
        A contemporary composer who made extensive use of
        <em>prolatio</em> techniques in his composition is Conlon
        Nancarrow.<span class="popover-container"

      </p>

      <p>
        Another counterpuntual technique that has been associated with the idea
        of recursion and self-similarity is the <em>crab</em> canon. A crab
        canon or <em>canon cancricans</em> results when a cantus firmus is used
        in its backward form –retrograde– as a counterpoint of itself in
        original form.<span class="popover-container"

        Johann Sebastian Bach makes use of this resource recurrently in his
        <em>Musical Offering,</em> BWV 1079, and in
        <em>The Art of Fugue,</em> BWV 1080. Hofstadter uses some of these works
        composed by Bach as analogous to the idea of a strange loop. According
        to Hofstadter, these canons are examples of recursive and
        self-referential structures present in Bach’s music.

      <p>
        In the piece <em>I am a Strange Loop,</em> I employ the idea of
        self-referentiality in a somewhat restricted and personal way: The
        process of referencing occurs between two different works, where one is
        developed almost entirely through the abstraction and posterior
        remapping of certain musical parameters coming from a source piece.
        Therefore, certain preexisting musical information recurs in a new form
        in a different work. This is the essence of my use of parametrical
        remapping as a compositional methodology. To a lesser extent, the method
        involves developing recursive processes that occur within the new piece,
        where the previously existing musical information sprouts across diverse
        musical parameters on the new composition and at different levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, an interesting inquiry that emerges with this methodology
        is connected to the perceptual connection between the preexisting piece
        and the new one or the degree of presence or absence of the source piece
        in the new one: Is it possible to create a new piece by remapping
        information from a preexistent one in a way that these abstract
        connections between the two become somehow audible? Is there a gray zone
        where, while we hear a new-to-us composition, some auditory cues are
        driving our perception to the recollection of a previously heard piece?
      </p>

      <h4>Section 1 – Remapping a Profile</h4>

      <p>
        As a departure point, I formalized the melodic profile of the theme from
        Canon No. 2 of the <em>Musical Offering</em> as a linear BPF. This BPF
        is used as a model for generating new musical representations of it.

        For this piece, I was interested in exploring the musical potential of
        the subharmonic scale as a source of harmonic material and pitches.
        Notice that the tonal center of the canon is C minor. For some
        theorists, the minor mode can be explained as deriving from an inversion
        of the natural harmonic series. This inversion yields a new scale known
        as <em>subharmonic.</em> The composer Harry Partch has termed the
        harmonic processes derived from the subharmonic scale as
        <em>utonality.</em

        The fundamental sub-harmonic note of a minor mode is the 5th note of its
        root chord –to be very precise, it’s the 5th note of its root chord plus
        2 cents. In this case, the C minor mode exists within the undertone
        series of G<sub>8</sub> (+2ct). I use the G<sub>8</sub> subharmonic as
        the source scale for my pitch and harmonic material in the first section
        of the piece.

        To create new melodic material, I used the melodic profile of the
        original theme as a BPF that I used to map the partials of the undertone
        series as points in a 2D space (ranging from 4 to 14), where each point
        represents one of the notes in the new melodic theme. This process is a
        <em>formal system</em> that can be expressed using a mathematical
        formulation:

        Mapping these partials into notes yields an inverted melodic theme to
        the original. The reason for this is that the direction of the
        sub-harmonics is inverted from the natural harmonic series, thus higher
        partials represent lower notes:

        process, consisting of progressive intervallic compression over various
        steps (in this case, eight). When these successive compressions are
        later organized sequentially, starting from the last step (flat line) to
        the initial step (original profile), this perceptually relates to a
        process of expansion. The BPF graph below shows the eight steps of the
        compression process of the original profile, superimposed on one
        another. In the score, I present these eight lines sequentially (see the
        score below), starting from the flat line and ending in the theme in its
        normal shape.

        The noteheads indicate the important or anchoring notes, and the lines

        In the domain of durations, I have formalized the melodic profile as a
        warping temporal factor that alters the chronometric density and
        durations of events at the level of the individual phrases and at the
        overall level after the phrases are concatenated. The x-axis represents
        time, and the y-axis represents the warping factor. Therefore, the
        higher y values yield a higher chronometric density of events and
        shorter durations, whereas the lower values yield longer durations and
        scarce events.

      <p>
        The form of the first section is determined as a loose analogy to the
        form of Bach’s canon –the source piece. It has two parts of a somewhat
        equivalent length. In the first part of the first section (m. 1-29), the
        formal process is derived from the expansion of the original theme,
        departing from a flat line of pitches and arriving at its original form
        –the most expanded melodic line– after eight iterations in m. 29 (sop.
        sax). After this, there is a climatic closing moment that produces a
        build-up of energy that reaches an abrupt break in m. 49. The second
        part of the first section develops the inverse idea. Instead of melodic
        expansion, here, the melodic material is progressively compressed until
        it gets to a line of repeated notes –a flat line– in m. 70. In addition,
        the melodic material results from the inversion of the original theme.
        Therefore, the formal idea for the first section resembles a type of
        palindrome or <em>cancricans</em> organization –although not canonical,
        rather, based on the expansion and compression of the thematic material
        and its inversion.

        and applied an algorithm to extract their virtual subharmonic
        fundamentals. Subsequently, I organized them based on their proximity to
        the original subharmonic fundamental, from which I derived my pitch
        material (G<sub>8</sub> + 2 cts). From this sorted list, I selected
        specific multiphonics and incorporated them at various points in the
        score. Essentially, the sonority of the multiphonics transitions from
        more consonant to more dissonant in relation to the perceived tonal
        center –C minor, derived from the G<sub>8</sub> subharmonic scale. See
        the example below:

      <h5>Outside the system</h5>

      <p>
        In the first version of the piece, the thematic material in the first
        section was developed as a single line that expanded and contracted in
        the baritone saxophone alone. The other instruments mostly played
        repeated pitches that expanded and contracted rhythmically, serving as a
        background. For the second and current version, I decided to re-compose
        the entire first section and distribute the thematic material across the
        four saxophones. Additionally, my intention was not for each of these
        phrases to stand out prominently in the texture; rather, I aimed to
        create a background from which these melodic figures would emerge and
        dissolve. My approach was to begin the main phrases on unison notes,
        which would be held and repeated, allowing the main theme to emerge from
        them.

        An additional layer, prominent throughout the score, features vibratos
        and varying degrees of airy sounds. This layer was developed during a
        later compositional stage. One of my heuristic strategies for this layer
        was to integrate the idea of speed fluctuation present in the rhythmic
        structure, for instance, having the vibrato evolve from slow to fast and
        vice versa.

        The air sounds, particularly prominent at the beginning of the piece,
        emerged as a means of connecting material from the improvised sections
        with earlier material in the piece. Given the essentially distinct sonic
        results of the improvised section and the written composition, I devised
        strategies to bridge them, incorporating some posterior adjustments.
        Ultimately, while the beginning and end of the piece sound quite
        different, they are sonically connected through the recurring presence
        of air and air sounds.

      <h4>Section 2 – Symbolic ring modulation</h4>

      <p>
        The second section of the piece comes as the result of applying symbolic
        ring modulation to the complete canon and transcribing that as the
        saxophone parts. For this, I computed the RM spectrum using the two
        voices of the original canon as the carriers and the fundamental note of
        the subharmonic scale (G) as the modulator. The result is a harmonic
        spectrum consisting of four sidebands:

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        This section is also derived from the source piece, still from a
        relatively abstract process as the calculation of a ring modulation
        spectrum. However, the notion of presence here somehow takes an
        unprecedented space since the choral is somehow perceptually relatable
        to the original Bach’s canon. Furthermore, formally, this section is a
        literal reproduction of the canon in a different harmonic universe and
        <em>time-warped:</em>
        I again used the melodic profile of Bach’s canon theme as a BPF to
        time-warp the complete choral.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is worth discussing here how this approach changed in two successive
        versions of the piece. For the first version, I wrote this section in
        regular metric notation with a fixed tempo. Even though the sound result
        should be of gradual <em>accelerandos</em> and
        <em>rallentandos</em> across large periods, this process yielded a
        fairly complex rhythmic notation, which made it too complex and somehow
        misleading for the performers. To explore a better alternative for this,
        in the second version, I changed this notation into fixed rhythmic
        values along with gradually speeding up/slowing down tempo marks. Since
        the ensemble moves in homophony, there are no issues of
        multi-temporality, as in the first section, where every phrase is warped
        differently and does not match with the other parts of the ensemble. In
        this case, it is necessary to adopt a general tempo and write each part
        in relation and proportion to it. The ring-modulation chorale was
        re-notated completely from the first to the second version. See below:

      <h5>Reeds duo part</h5>

      <p>
        The reeds duo consists of an accordion and an organetto portativo, which
        appear in the second section of the piece. Initially, I envisioned them
        as emerging from the ring-modulation chorale, where they gradually
        prolong certain pitches before becoming more active and independent. To
        achieve this, the tuning of the organetto is adjusted to align with the
        microtonality present in the saxophone parts. The accordion, on the
        other hand, remains more subdued at first, acting as a subtle background
        that slowly becomes more prominent towards the end of the section. The
        two instruments become more prominent in the final improvised section.

      <h4>Section 3 – Improvisation</h4>

      <p>
        The final section of the piece consists of an improvisation part that
        follows some guidelines. Overall, in this section, the note G
        (fundamental pitch from the subharmonic scale) stands out. In the first
        part of it, the saxophones must choose from a subset of multiphonics,
        all of them containing the pitch G within their component notes. This
        gives the overall sonority a relatively homogenous sound. Gradually, the
        material expands to include vibrato and flutter-tongue sounds,
        ultimately fading into air sounds, connecting back with this material as
        it was presented in the first part of the piece.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, the reeds duo becomes responsive to what the saxophone quartet
        does without further indications of actions or techniques. The
        saxophones’ part evolves gradually; multiphonic sounds become pitched
        sounds (note G) with vibrato and flutter-tongue, and finally, these
        morph into air sounds. The piece fades into air and noise.

      <h5>Electronics</h5>

      <p>
        The electronics appear in the improvised section and are primarily
        generated from brain readings of one of the performers using an fNIRS
        helmet. These readings are live-mapped into digital signal processes
        within Ableton Live 12 through a Max4Live device that I developed in
        collaboration with Ryan McCardle: fNIRS_to_Live, which I will discuss
        more on it in the section ‘Contributions.’
      </p>
      <p>
        For the current performance, the selected processes included resonant
        filters, panning, delay, reverb, and a granulator, with parameters such
        as delay times, the number of resonators, and grain size and density.
        While fNIRS_to_Live allows for mapping all forty-two stream channels
        coming from the fNIRS helmet into Ableton Live parameters, I limited the
        mapping to sixteen channels for this performance. Each of the sixteen
        channels affects one parameter individually. See the video below:

      <p>
        The idea of a strange loop is also connected to the electronic part, as
        brain readings –mainly taken from the auditory and motor cortex– are
        initially triggered by the auditory stimulation from the sounding music.
        During the performance, the performers should respond to these
        improvised sounds. These responses, in turn, create new sounds, which
        influence the brain readings, forming a recursive musical strange loop.
        The result of this process is a subtle layer of electronic sounds and
        processes that seamlessly blend into the overall texture, adding an
        additional dimension: a kind of <em>aura.</em>
