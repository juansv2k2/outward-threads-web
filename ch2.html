        Throughout my life, ideas around music, computation, and cognition have
        been important to me, acting as almost invisible threads linking the
        various disciplines I have been passionate about since a young age. As
        part of a generation that grew up with digital computers at the reach of
        a hand, my artistic practice has been deeply shaped by digital
        technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        After many years dedicated to piano performance, experimental music
        composition, and live electronic improvisation, I recently felt drawn
        back to academia, driven by a desire to better understand the “special”
        brain of musicians and what occurs during the act of music-making.<span

          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >Or at least, that was the plan. In the end, my master's research
            project looked into aspects of musical perceptual expertise, in
            particular in tasks related to speech perception:
            <strong>Juan S. Vassallo, </strong>"Music expert-novice differences
            in speech perception,"
            <em>University of Victoria Repository Dspace</em> (2019)

        As I delved deeper into this new field of knowledge, I began noticing
        intriguing conceptual parallels between the workings of the human mind
        and computational concepts that have been familiar to me since a young
        age. For instance, I observed that research trends in cognitive
        psychology often aim to formalize cognitive processes as
        <em>systems,</em>
        modeling the mind computationally, which often involves using
        mathematical or statistical models, such as Gaussian distributions,
        Bayesian inference, fuzzy logic, etc. I found these intersections
        fascinating.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “The central hypothesis of cognitive science is that thinking can best
          be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and
          computational procedures that operate on those structures.”

      <p>
        Following these ideas, I naturally began to wonder whether computational
        conceptual models could contribute to our understanding of the creative
        process, especially in art, and in music composition, my primary field
        of practice.
        <em>
          Can creative thinking be effectively captured through computational
          insight? Can even the most intuition-driven aspects of creativity be
          systematically analyzed and modeled? If so, could these ultimately be
          replicated by a computer?
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        I soon realized that these questions challenged the traditional –and
        somewhat romanticized– view of artistic creation as a mysterious,
        elusive process.
        <em
          >What might the implications be for music creators? Could composers
          enhance their work by understanding the cognitive functions at play
          during the creative act? Or is it more beneficial for an artist to
          allow creativity and intuition to remain, as they are often perceived:
          inexplicable?</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        I felt that seriously pursuing these questions was worthwhile, even
        though other practitioners have explored these inquiries for some time.
        In my case, being a composer with a background in programming, and, more
        recently, cognition and brain sciences positioned me well to integrate
        these fields into a multidisciplinary project. Eventually, I formalized
        these inquiries into a doctoral project in artistic research with an
        interdisciplinary focus. This project would integrate theoretical
        discussions from these various fields with the development of my
        creative practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Outward Threads</em> grew out of these early speculations, evolving
        into a collection of musical works accompanied by analytical,
        theoretical, and reflective writings that explore broader studies on
        human creative cognition, computation, artificial intelligence, and
        intersections between them. I have pursued this integration because I
        believe it offers valuable insights for practitioners who, like me, are
        interested in exploring the nature and mechanisms of the creative
        process, its potential connections to computational paradigms, and its
        manifestation in the act of composing. Importantly, this exploration
        does not overlook the social and cultural dimensions of a compositional
        practice, incorporating reflections on the ethical, institutional, and
        historical contexts that shape it.

      <p>
        This text and the accompanying artistic work are the culmination of my
        research at the Grieg Academy, University of Bergen, over the past four
        years. What follows is an exploration of the artistic outcomes and
        reflective insights of the project <em>Outward Threads.</em>

        but also to that of artistic creation. In this light, the act of
        creation is seen as a process of exploration of a labyrinthic space
        within which the creative process unfolds, through the search and
        discovery across a structure of complex passageways. At the core of the
        labyrinth metaphor, therefore, lies the idea of <em>exploration.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But what exactly is being explored? One could argue that the external
        world and our internal representation of it become the input for our
        creative processes. Theorists from various fields have conceptualized
        the idea of mental representations of concepts as a type of mental
        geographic space. A direct example of this is a theory of cognition by
        P. Gärdenfors, known as <em>conceptual spaces.</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            I will discuss Gärdenfors’ theory of conceptual spaces in the
            section ‘Multidisciplinary Insights.’
          </span></span
        >
        In this view, exploring concepts in the mind can be metaphorically
        equated to navigating a mental space –whether best described as a
        labyrinth, a topography, or an ocean may be a matter of personal
        perspective. The notion of exploration as a creative mechanism is
        central to this reflection. The metaphor of the labyrinth ultimately
        crystallizes as a representation of the creative process for each work.
        However, it is not necessary to confine the idea strictly to the
        labyrinth; its use remains flexible.

        In the opening of her book
        <em>The Creative Mind: Myths and Mechanisms,</em>
        Margaret Boden poses a quite thought-provoking statement:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Computers and creativity make interesting partners with respect to
          two different projects. One, which interests me the most, is
          understanding human creativity. The other is trying to produce machine
          creativity –or rather machine “creativity”– in which the computer at
          least appears to be creative to some degree.”

      <p>
        As has become apparent, one of the primary interests of this research
        overlaps with Boden’s first project. This discussion is grounded in
        theories of cognition and will eventually explore connections with the
        field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, tracing these
        connections does not imply equating the creative process to the
        functioning of a computer. Rather, as Boden suggests, such comparisons
        can provide valuable insights into creative processes through certain
        analogies with conceptual frameworks from computation and AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second project, however, concerning the creativity of computers or
        AI, cannot be entirely avoided. It surfaces occasionally throughout
        these reflections and will be addressed timely in this text. As the
        reader may be aware, AI –especially generative AI (gen-AI)– has emerged
        recently as an ubiquitous technological advancement. The astonishing
        results it produces in generating text and multimedia content are still
        a mystery to many. Potentially, and aside from too technical
        discussions, drawing analogies between these models and the functioning
        of the human mind could offer valuable insights to a broad audience on
        how these systems operate, and potentially, how they might evolve in the
        near future.
      </p>
      <p>
        But coming back again to the idea of exploring a labyrinth, it can be
        argued that there are different ways of doing it. Some will do it
        following certain logical steps, others just following their intuition
        –or gut feeling. Maybe it is even possible to shift between these two:
        Some movements might require some logical consideration, others just
        feel necessary.

          Yes, there are several logical strategies that can help you find your
          way out of a labyrinth. Some of these strategies are based on
          mathematical principles, while others rely on simple rules of thumb.
          Here are a few well-known methods:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>The Right-Hand (or Left-Hand) Rule:</strong><br />

            <strong>How it works:</strong>
            Keep one hand on the wall (either the right or left) and continue
            walking, keeping your hand on the wall at all times.<br />

            <strong> Why it works: </strong>This method ensures that you never
            revisit the same area, and eventually, you’ll find an exit. It works
            for any simply-connected maze (a maze without loops or disconnected
            parts). However, it might not work in a maze with loops or multiple
            disjoint walls.<br />
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple and easy to follow.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cons:</strong> In mazes with multiple loops or islands,
                you may end up walking in circles around a central area without
                finding the exit.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bread Crumbs or Marking Your Path:</strong><br />

            <strong>How it works:</strong> Leave markers (physical objects or
            chalk marks) at intersections or along paths to help track where
            you've been.<br />

            <strong> Why it works:</strong> By marking paths you've already
            explored, you can avoid revisiting dead ends and make sure you try
            new paths.<br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Pros:</strong> Helps in any kind of maze, including ones
                with loops or complex structures.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cons:</strong> You need something to mark the path with.
                In a very large or complex maze, it can become overwhelming to
                manage.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pledge Algorithm: </strong><br />

            <strong>How it works:</strong> This method is useful when the
            right-hand or left-hand rule fails (e.g., when the labyrinth has
            loops or islands). The idea is to set a fixed direction (e.g.,
            north), and after hitting a wall, you turn and count how many left
            or right turns you make, always trying to balance out your turns.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong> Pros:</strong> Works for more complex mazes with loops.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cons:</strong> More mentally demanding, requires
                constant counting and awareness of directions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trémaux’s Algorithm (Backtracking): </strong><br />

            <strong>How it works:</strong> This is a more systematic approach
            where you keep track of intersections. When you reach an
            intersection, you choose an unexplored path. If you reach a dead-end
            or revisit a known intersection, you backtrack to the previous
            intersection and try a different unexplored path.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Pros:</strong> Guaranteed to find the exit eventually,
                and works for any type of labyrinth, including complex ones with
                loops.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cons:</strong> Requires good memory or marking of
                intersections, and can take a long time to explore all paths.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Look for Patterns: </strong><br />

            <strong>How it works:</strong> Some mazes are designed with patterns
            that repeat or have symmetry. By observing these, you can often
            figure out shortcuts or predict where certain paths lead.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong> Pros:</strong> Can be very quick if the maze has a
                noticeable structure.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Cons:</strong> Requires keen observation and may not
                work in irregular mazes.
              </li>

        What if we applied the idea of logical exploration to a creative act?
        Consider a musical example: many creative processes involve following a
        sequence of logical steps or adhering to specific rules. For instance,
        composing a chorale or a fugue typically requires knowledge of tonal
        harmony and counterpoint, along with following a set of strict rules. By
        doing so, one is almost certain to produce a result. Perhaps even one of
        artistic value.

        Of course, that’s not the only way music-making unfolds. Many musicians
        who improvise brilliantly or reharmonize songs in completely unexpected
        ways often say, “I have no idea what I’m doing.” These examples
        illustrate two seemingly contrasting approaches to musical exploration:
        one grounded in rational thought and methodical processes, and the other
        rooted in what we typically understand as <em>intuition</em>. Discussing
        these two modes of thinking –the rational and the intuitive– will play a
        significant role in this reflection. It is important to note, at the
        outset, that they represent distinct forms of <em>cognition,</em> a
        concept that will be explored in greater detail in the next chapter.

        Margaret Boden further expands the idea of exploration in human
        creativity as the result of exploring, recombining, and transforming
        mental spaces.<span class="popover-container"

            I will discuss Margaret A. Boden's theory of Creativity on the

        In her words, the act of merely exploring a space seems a somewhat
        straightforward task. Experimenting, observing the possibilities,
        experimenting again, going back to the starting point if it was not
        satisfactory, or we want to explore a different way, and so on. But the
        idea of recombining and transforming the space entails somehow that we
        can change it.

            If we think again of the labyrinth, what would this entail? Perhaps
            jumping over the walls? Or breaking through them? The metaphor of
            the labyrinth may seem rigid now. However, I will maintain it, as it
            ultimately serves the purpose of illustrating the concept of
            exploration.

        For Boden, the process of creative exploration mainly relies on mental
        strategies known as <em>heuristics,</em

        which guide us in navigating complex mental spaces through a form of
        search. In the field of AI, the concept of <em>search spaces</em> has
        long existed as a method for exploring potential solutions to problems.
        This search space is sometimes traversed by employing algorithms or
        systems of rules; other times, it is navigated in ways that may not make
        much sense to the human mind. In the following sections, I will focus on
        these various exploration methods, using as a starting point some of the
        conceptual connections between human creative cognition and AI. I will
        examine how these explorations unfold for each piece, utilizing various
        methodologies that may or may not involve computational creative tools.

        So far, it seems that in this text, I have put a large effort into
        describing mental processes. However, another interesting problem that I
        will discuss, in addition to mental complexities and mental
        representation, deals with the notion of embodiment and whether the body
        might have agency in the process of creatively exploring for creating
        music. Is the body a feasible tool for exploring creative spaces in
        music composition? How does a computational model fit the concept of
        embodiment, grounded on knowledge that is acquired and applied through
        action rather than through description or formal reasoning? The concept
        of <em>embodied cognition</em> is a relatively recent one which has
        found a stronghold in the study of cognition. However, it also raises
        questions and problems, which I hope to put into focus.

        <em>Outward Threads</em> is fundamentally an artistic research project
        focused on producing primarily artistic outcomes. It is important to
        emphasize that this project does not aim to conduct scientific studies
        or employ methodologies from non-artistic research disciplines.
        Accordingly, both its methods and results should be understood within an
        artistic research framework. However, as mentioned earlier, the project
        embraces an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from various
        fields that inform the artistic work and expanding its inquiries beyond
        a strictly musical scope. The implications of these concepts are complex
        and potentially far-reaching. Therefore, this endeavor would benefit
        from a multidisciplinary perspective, presenting concepts from these
        fields in an accessible way that simplifies technical aspects for a
        diverse audience. While these reflections aim to delve into these
        theories, this text is not exclusively aimed at specialists in any of
        these fields. Furthermore, an important goal of this text is to make
        these concepts accessible to a wide range of readers, particularly those
        without a background in cognition, computer sciences, or even music.
