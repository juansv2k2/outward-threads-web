          The project <em>Outward Threads</em> is an artistic investigation
          rooted in music composition, integrating computational frameworks from
          machine learning and artificial intelligence to create new music. It
          seeks to develop a fresh approach to established compositional
          methodologies within computer-assisted composition, as well as
          incorporating novel tools. Some of these contributions, including the
          development of creative software tools, are discussed. Theoretically,
          the project examines various forms of creative cognition and their
          manifestation in Western art contemporary music composition, drawing
          insights from cognitive sciences and AI. These discussions provide a
          framework for presenting each composition within the project and serve
          as starting points for exploring individual creative methodologies,
          and techniques. The goal is to deepen the understanding of these
          cognitive processes and their interactions in the creative process,
          aiming to bridge the gap between purely neurocognitive approaches and
          practice-based research. In a broader context, the project examines
          ethical aspects of music and composition and the composer’s role in
          society. Finally, it considers the impact of new technologies
          –particularly generative AI– on creative processes and discusses
          influential practitioners and current trends in the field.
