      <h2>Conclusions?</h2>
      <hr />

      <p>
        Throughout this reflection, I have discussed the conceptual background
        and constructive processes underlying the works that constitute the
        artistic outcome of the project. These discussions were framed within
        paradigms and theories from cognitive science, drawing connections
        between human cognition and computational frameworks from the field of
        AI. This parallel essentially was aimed at better understanding aspects
        of creative cognition based on how computers attempt to simulate it.
        Additionally, discussion around these methodologies sought to illustrate
        some constructive aspects of the works.
      </p>

      <p>
        A reader might claim, however, that it became clear that the complexity
        of human cognitive processes –particularly creative processes– cannot be
        reduced to descriptive or analytical observations. And I essentially
        agree with this: some might argue that a shortcoming of this project is
        its inability to fully explain the creative act from these perspectives.
        In response, I would argue that, after reviewing an extensive body of
        literature from various fields, I am convinced that no one has ever
        fully accomplished this, and perhaps no one ever will.

      <p>
        Nevertheless, I believe the approach taken here remains valid, as it
        highlights another crucial aspect that emerges through research and
        reflection: the creative process for each piece reveals that all forms
        of creative thought –at least those discussed in this text– are
        intricately intertwined. These explorations systematically lead to one
        main point: while these processes may appear contrasting, and some may
        dominate in particular works, it is essential to understand them as
        three facets of the same entity.
      </p>

      <p>
        One contribution of this project may lie in offering insights that
        highlight how the reality of the creative process extends far beyond any
        single paradigm. In this sense, the project finally aligns with the
        notion that any attempt to replicate the human creative process at an
        artistic level –such as through gen-AI– is likely to face significant
        challenges without a comprehensive integration of these three paradigms
        and possibly other aspects of human cognition that were not discussed in
        this project.

      <h4>A neurocognitive perspective</h4>
      <p>
        Some empirical support for this notion has emerged relatively recently
        in the field of cognitive neurosciences.<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content">
            Cognitive neuroscience is a subfield of neuroscience that studies
            the biological processes that underlie human cognition, especially
            in regards to the relation between brain structures, activity, and
            cognitive functions.

        I didn’t directly discuss neuroscientific or cognitive neuroscientific
        insights because it would greatly extend the scope and length of this
        text and potentially deviate significantly from the artistic focus of
        the research. However, for some specific issues, it might be relevant to
        bring some insights from this field.

        Essentially, there is some evidence that the neural processes that take
        place during the various stages of creative thinking tasks are
        characterized by <strong>frequent and rapid transitions</strong> between
        the brain’s networks responsible for spontaneous and deliberate
        thought.<span class="popover-container">

        </span>
        The brain’s prefrontal cortex (PFC) seems to play a key role in this
        process:<span class="popover-container">

          </span>
        </span>
        When the PFC is less active, as in tasks like instrumental improvisation
        or lyrics improvisation in freestyle rap, spontaneous creativity is
        enhanced by reducing inhibitory constraints and allowing stronger
        associative thinking.<span class="popover-container">

        </span>
        In contrast, a more active PFC seems to support deliberate creative
        processes, helping individuals evaluate and select ideas based on
        context-specific goals.

        In addition, some studies suggest that the generation of creative ideas
        is linked to increased functional connectivity between the PFC and the
        default mode network (DMN), a brain network mainly active during rest
        and associated with self-reflection and imaginative processes.<span

      <p>
        The problem with a solely cognitive or neuroscientific approach is that
        even if creative processes in the brain could be precisely mapped
        –identifying where they occur and which areas are involved– this does
        not necessarily explain the relationship between physical brain
        structures and creative thoughts, or between thoughts and broader
        conceptual frameworks. Cognitive neuroscience, simply put, is still far
        from resolving the distinction between <em>brain</em> and
        <em>mind</em>.<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content"
            >The problem of <em>mind</em> and <em>brain,</em> or
            <em>mind</em> and <em>body</em> for the sake of the argument, is a
            longstanding one, rooted in philosophical ideas from Plato, the
            distinction between body and soul in Aristotle and later Greek
            philosophers, and Descartes’ dualism, which separates the mind (or
            soul) from the body. Contemporary psychological trends generally
            agree that the mind emerges as an emergent property of the physical
            properties of the brain. However, the relationship between mental
            and physical properties remains a complex and debated topic. While
            modern psychology leans toward <em>physicalism</em> (the idea that
            the mind is a product of the brain’s physical processes), there are
            still diverse perspectives within the field. Neuropsychology
            explores the relationship between brain function and behavior,
            focusing on how specific areas of the brain are related to mental
            states. In cognitive science, the focus is more on understanding
            cognitive processes –such as perception, memory, and
            decision-making– through computational models, behavioral
            experiments, and other methods. While it does not always prioritize
            the precise neural mechanisms (the “how” and “where” in the brain),
            it recognizes that cognitive processes are rooted in the brain's
            functioning.</span
          >
        </span>
        Viewed from this perspective, the project offers valuable insights from
        an artistic research standpoint that aligns with recent cognitive and
        neuroscientific findings. I believe this, in itself, represents a
        meaningful contribution to the field –if not the most significant one,
        in addition to the artistic approaches and technical developments
        discussed throughout.
      </p>

      <p>
        Further research grounded in creative practice and informed by cognitive
        theories could potentially help bridge this gap. For instance, a more
        focused artistic research project examining each individual cognitive
        paradigm and exploring its emergence in creative processes could provide
        more detailed and systematic descriptions and analyses, further
        connecting practice-based research with neurocognitive approaches. This
        project ultimately lacks that level of specificity.
      </p>

      <h4>Composition and institutionalization</h4>
      <p>
        At its core, creating music is a deeply sociocultural act, a truth that
        applies across most musical styles, genres, and trends –some shaped more
        by market dynamics, others by historical practices, and so on. In the
        field of WACM, the act of composing is deeply rooted in a longstanding
        institutionalized practice shaped by historical power dynamics,
        legitimations, directives, and stylistic premises. In this context,
        compositional decisions –whether rational, formalized, physical, or
        intuitive– are strongly influenced by the negotiation of meaning and
        value within cultural institutions, peers, and practitioners. The
        challenge in this sense is to rely solely on the notion of creativity to
        explain the process of composition fully. The most visible risk of
        institutionalization is that the label of “creative,” whether applied to
        a composer or a work of art, may stem more from negotiations of meaning
        and valuation within cultural institutions, often driven by the
        socio-cultural values and dominant political ideas of a given time or
        place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, composing can –and should– be regarded as a creative process:
        composers possess specialized skills that enable them to develop
        strategies of exploration, leading to novel, interesting, and valuable
        results. However, these explorations, ideas, insights, and creations are
        deeply rooted in a context, practice, and tradition that extend beyond
        individual subjective experiences. As I see it, this needs to be
        consciously reflected by anyone who aims to develop a practice within
        the field of WACM.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Zembylas and Niederauer suggest, the term “creativity” risks becoming
        somewhat inflated in this context.<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content">
            <strong>Zembylas and Niederauer,</strong>

              Composing.</em
            >
          </span>
        </span>
        Recognizing this could encourage composers to move away from some of
        these institutionalized practices, potentially exploring other musical
        traditions, art forms, cultural perspectives, functions, worldviews, or
        cosmogonies, if that aligns with their artistic or personal goals. While
        it is impossible to separate the creative act from its sociocultural
        implications completely, it is possible to observe some of these forces
        that, at first glance, may not be visible.
      </p>

      <h4>The borders of formalization</h4>
      <p>
        Music is a narrative shaped by multiple layers of operations that may
        indeed utilize formal systems for the generation, transformation, and
        organization of this narrative. In addition to this, creating music
        requires the intervention of tactile actions, sensory perceptions, and
        mental associations, possibly non-linear and chaotic.<span
          class="popover-container"
        >
          *<span class="popover-content">
            In mathematics and science, a nonlinear system (or a non-linear
            system) is a system in which the change of the output is not
            proportional to the change of the input. <em>Chaotic</em> describes
            systems that, while deterministic, exhibit extreme sensitivity to
            initial conditions, leading to seemingly random and unpredictable
            behavior. Chaos often arises in non-linear systems and is
            characterized by patterns that are complex yet governed by
            underlying rules. Sources: "Nonlinear System," Wikipedia, last

        Furthermore, these actions seem crucial to evaluate results and inform
        decisions within diverse frameworks in which a musical work might be
        conceived.
      </p>

      <p>
        Formalizations of conventionally established or known compositional
        parameters usually operate at the level of conceptual representation;
        however, some of them are ultimately too complex for computational
        representation. Potentially, the interaction of these parameters with
        other formalized elements can become overwhelmingly complex. This
        ultimately prevents its symbolic representation into computationally
        operable forms –like numbers or strings.

        In this sense, the idea of formalization as a computational approach or
        “inside the system” became more a practical rather than foundational
        approach, local and strategic in its application. This idea finds some
        resonance with something proposed by the composer Horacio Vaggione:
        while music does leverage tools and knowledge from formal sciences, this
        formalization is not central to musical creation. In other words,
        computational systematization can aid in the creative process of
        composition but cannot completely substitute it.

          Composers are concerned with the creation of musical situations
          emerging concretely out of critical interaction with their materials,
          including their algorithms. This task cannot be exhausted by a linear
          (a priori, non-interactive) problem-solving approach. Interaction is
          here matching an important feature of musical composition processes,
          giving room for the emergence of irreducible situations through
          non-linear interactions.

        Procedural creative impulses and aesthetic foundations rooted in theory
        and practice remain present in intuition, even when they cannot be fully
        consciously expressed. Ultimately, I believe that artistic creation
        arises at the intersection of imagination, sensory perception, and
        formalization, and navigating this interplay remains an open question
        for me and possibly for every practitioner, especially in the field of
        CAC. Ideally, computers should not be seen as limiting but as tools for
        preserving and exploring the complexity and nuance inherent in musical
        ideas. When a computer facilitates this interplay between composer and
        system, it becomes artistically enriching and desirable. However, I
        remain skeptical about whether it is possible to fully explore the
        depths and nuances of musical creation using computers alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the creative outcome of this project, engaging intuitively and
        embodying the results of computational formalizations and generative
        outcomes through a feedback process turned out to be essential. From my
        artistic perspective, this interaction consistently emerged as the space
        where the most interesting creative exchanges took place. Therefore, a
        potentially beneficial approach for composers could be to view this
        balance as a natural part of the creative process rather than allowing
        it to skew too heavily toward any of them. I acknowledge, however, that
        this is a highly personal perspective shaped by my own process and does
        not seek to question or label any approach or methodology as inherently
        right or wrong.

        ultimately came as a natural consequence of the artistic inquiries–
        should be viewed as a voice speaking about how the encounter between
        humans, computers, and AI in the context of artistic practice can foster
        relevant artistic questions. And this is especially relevant in current
        times, where questions around gen-AI revolve around the replacement of
        the artist or even the end of art.

        Technological advancements have always opened the door to new musical
        investigations. Initially, these advancements should be seen as
        opportunities to explore new creative processes and to reconsider
        fundamental notions such as technique, materiality, the role of the
        artist, and even the definition of art itself. It is also worth noting
        that this kind of paradigm shift has occurred many times throughout
        history. Even though we may not fully understand the depth of the
        paradigm shift that AI will bring to art practitioners –and ultimately
        to Humanity– I believe that it is possible to offer new visions and
        creative approaches to the emerging landscape while still maintaining a
        critical perspective.

        Throughout this project, I have sought to highlight the pertinence and
        importance of AI methods from both conceptual and constructive
        perspectives, ensuring they serve as meaningful tools for expression. In
        other words, whenever I employed these methods, I engaged in deep
        reflection on their use and their connection to the message or intention
        of the artistic work. This process required me to repeatedly ask myself
        why I was using these tools, what they offered, and how they were
        artistically relevant. This continuous reflection contributed to
        reshaping my perspective on these methods along the process and helped
        me develop a critical view, which I believe is a significant outcome of
        the research process. I hope this attitude may inspire other artists to
        adopt a similar approach.
