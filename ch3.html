        In this chapter, I will first focus on topics related to music and
        composition, offering a personal perspective on key issues that
        contextualize the artistic outcomes of the project. Subsequently, I will
        address broad concepts and terminology related to cognition and
        creativity within the fields of cognitive and brain sciences. Following
        this, I will explore ideas from computation and AI. These two latter
        subsections primarily serve as literature reviews and conceptual
        overviews, providing a theoretical framework for discussing specific
        creative processes. While not exhaustive, they aim to establish the
        conceptual foundations needed to guide readers as the discussion becomes
        more specialized.
      </p>

      <h3>Music Composition</h3>

      <p>
        The artistic outcomes of this project primarily take the form of
        score-based musical compositions. These works are generally intended for
        performance by acoustic instruments or voices, often accompanied by a
        significant electronic component, either as fixed media or live
        electronics. Some pieces also incorporate other mediums, such as video
        and text. In this sense, my creative practice stems from the tradition
        of Western art music, particularly in forms of expression that emerged
        after the mid-20th century and continue to evolve today. This music is
        commonly referred to as Western art contemporary music (referred to
        hereafter as WACM). A significant portion of my workflow relies on
        computer-assisted composition (hereafter referred to as CAC) tools and
        methods. Historically, WACM and CAC have been closely connected,
        evolving in tandem, and it is widely recognized that WACM often
        encompasses practices related to CAC.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the outset, I would like to define the scope of WACM composition as a
        culturally situated practice that I develop in a particular place and
        time in our world. Therefore, every creative act within this process
        relies not only on domain-specific (musical) decisions but also on
        physical spaces, political-economic contexts, societal and
        institutionalized<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content">
            The institutionalization of art music dates back to the
            establishment of conservatories outside courts and churches in
            17th-century Europe. By the mid-20th century, many states had
            created cultural apparatuses to support and guide musical creation
            through policies, subsidies, and commissions. Institutionalization
            not only conferred social recognition and legitimacy to established
            forms but also elevated the status of performers within these
            systems, often excluding practitioners outside these circles. It
            also introduced new categorizations of musical knowledge and
            economic models, with academic diplomas symbolizing prestige. This
            institutional focus, emphasizing notation and “score-based music,”
            has sometimes widened the gap between formally educated musicians
            and those trained through oral traditions. Western music and its
            contemporary practices became institutionalized earlier than other
            genres like jazz and folk, which followed later in the century.
            Today, still many musical expressions remain outside formal
            institutional structures. See
            <strong>Ingrid Le Gargasson, </strong>"The challenges of
            institutionalization of musical knowledge," Revue d’anthropologie
            des connaissances 14, no. 14-2 (2020).

        environments (institutions, teachers, colleagues, composers, performers,
        technicians, and many other agents), as well as artistic tools and
        materialities (paper, computers, software, sound, instruments,
        etc.).<span class="popover-container"

        intend to delve deeply into such disentanglement. However, I acknowledge
        the significant impact this network of agencies has on every aspect of
        my practice, from the smallest musical choices to long-term life
        decisions. I will address some contextual and ethical aspects of
        compositional practice later in this text.

      <p>
        I would like to begin discussing my creative practice by relating its
        common practical aspects to certain existing artistic practices. Within
        this project, <em>composition</em> is understood, first, in terms of
        timescales, as a long-term cognitive act. It is generally accepted to
        occur over long periods, differently from
        <em>improvisation,</em> although this distinction has been observed as a
        continuous spectrum of possibilities rather than a clear-cut
        separation.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            The notion of “long-term” varies among different composers. However,
            the focus here is to highlight the distinction between real-time
            musical creation rather than exploring what “long-term” means to
            various composers or how this concept has been studied from a
            psychological perspective. See, for example,
            <strong>Nicolas Donin and Jacques Theureau</strong>, "Theoretical
            and methodological issues related to long-term creative cognition:
            The case of musical composition,"
            <em>Cognition, Technology and Work</em> 9, no. 4 (2007),
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10111-007-0082-z" target="_blank"
              >https://doi.org/10.1007/s10111-007-0082-z</a
            >.</span
          ></span
        >
        Still, improvisation plays some role in some of my compositions, where
        performers are invited to improvise, usually following some guidelines
        (for example, in the final section of the piece
        <em> I am a Strange Loop</em>). Second, the act of composing yields some
        symbolic notation in the form of a score that should be performed by
        musicians. This score usually mediates between the piece as the result
        of my thought and the actual sound result. My scores may embody
        different forms, from detailed musical notation to written instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that music composition involves the organization of sound. As
        a time-based sonic art, this organization unfolds by structuring sound
        over time to create categories of meaning.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            A concise definition of meaning is
            <em> 'what something expresses or represents.'</em> in
            <strong>Cambridge Dictionary Online</strong>, s.v. “Meaning,”
            accessed Oct. 27, 2024,
            <a
              href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/meaning"

            >.</span
          ></span
        >
        These categories emerge through the relationships, significances, or
        sensations that organized sound conveys, which are interpreted through
        context, intent, and subjectivity. Musical organization, therefore, can
        be understood as the structuring and systematizing of sonic phenomena
        into a clear, defined, and often standardized framework –a concept
        closely tied to <em>formalization,</em

      <h3>Music as communication</h3>
      <p>
        My creative processes usually begin with a question, an inquiry –or
        perhaps a series of them. The purpose of the artwork, then, becomes
        responding to those questions from a creative standpoint. At the core,
        these inquiries emerge fundamentally from a desire to convey something:
        a personal longing for a form of interhuman expressive connection.
        Essentially, I view the act of music composition as a communicative
        act.<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            The first person from whom I took this idea is the Italian composer
            Luca Belcastro, who spent many years working among Latin American
            composers aiming to construct networks of collaboration between
            peers around the continent. I owe him enormous gratitude for his
            great teachings and his generosity.

          reality in which he lives, relates to himself, with his own
          sensitivity, his needs, curiosities, and emotions. For this reason and
          for the fact that it is a social animal, an innate demand invites it
          to share its inner world with others, with the society in which it
          finds itself. From all this arises the desire and need for a
          communicative act.”

        Initially, my ideas in this regard stem from a two-folded ground. On the
        one hand, the many parallels that exist between music and language have
        led many authors to argue in favor of a common evolutionary origin:
        music, as a human evolutive trait, has been linked to a proto-linguistic
        form of communication.<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            The literature on this topic is vast, but some very influential
            reading for me have been <strong>Aniruddh D. Patel</strong>,
            <em>Music, Language, and the Brain</em> (New York: Oxford University
            Press, Incorporated, 2007), <strong>Ray Jackendoff</strong>,

            >. See also <strong>Mengxia Yu</strong> et al., "The shared neural

          </span>
        </span>
        On the other hand, its longstanding existence within human societies has
        provided it with the capacity of music to encapsulate meaning that can
        be effectively shared between individuals and groups.

        But <em>meaning</em> encompasses not only propositional,
        logical-symbolic, rationalizable, or verbalizable representations. It
        also involves sensuous appreciations that sometimes cannot be directly
        related to a form of rational or conscious thought. In particular,
        musical meaning involves essentially aesthetic judgments based on
        unconscious and emotional experiences.<span class="popover-container"

        In this sense, I view the nature of music as dual, consisting of a
        complex combination of abstract formalizations –which, most of the time,
        deal with more or less complex structures and forms of sonic temporal
        organization– with sensuous forms, mainly related to aesthetic and
        emotional experiences.

          sheer sonic beauty of instrumental timbres.”

        The need for communication sparks the work and leads it toward points of
        interest that I consider relevant to express:
        <em>what I want to talk about.</em> In this sense, there isn’t a unique
        topic my music speaks about. Rather, each piece says different things.
        Maybe some common aura might be perceived as encompassing them: I am
        very interested in the interplay between mankind, nature, and
        technology. Of course, these are three huge overarching themes that have
        been the focus of possibly all the artistic productions in History,
        leaving aside religion and religious issues (since as I am not a
        religious person, I don’t have a strong connection with these). My
        artistic interests are mainly centered around the relationship between
        these themes, especially in today’s world. I am particularly interested
        in using my work to explore and respond to current societal and
        political issues. Additionally, my works are curious about sonic and
        musical translations of natural phenomena and natural processes and
        potentially discovering some aesthetical value in these representations.

      <h3>Musical material and organization</h3>

      <p>
        The discussion around musical material is a dense one. Musical material
        refers to the set of sonic elements that serve as the starting point for
        composing a musical work. Within my work, musical material is conceived
        in relation to its semiotic dimensions: as a vehicle of meaning and as a
        building block for a musical message. In this context, the term
        <em>semiotics</em> refers to the study of music as a system of signs,
        encompassing its creation, perception, and interpretation within
        cultural and symbolic contexts.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            Especially relevant have been the readings in
            <strong>Jean-Jacques Nattiez</strong>,

        There are two main discussions around the idea of musical material that
        are important in my work. On the one hand, the discussion around
        <em>historical</em> musical material and how musical elements from
        different historical contexts are used as material in new music.<span

          “As in society, temporal structures in a composition are formed by way
          of memory. The memories brought forth, inherent in the musical
          material, also form a relationship to the memory of the place of
          production. In this sense, musical material pre-exists, as it forms a
          dialogue with the material conditions of its production, the composer

        There is always a trace of extra-musical meaning in my material. For me,
        musical material is often linked to the representation of something
        beyond itself, something external to its phenomenology. This does not
        imply that my choice of material is free from aesthetic judgments rooted
        in its sonic qualities –those are always present to some degree.
        However, in my practice, considerations of musical material are
        typically driven by conceptual connections.

        Even though my musical material is usually charged with some
        extra-musical meaning, my music is not devoid of
        <em>semi-autonomic</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            The concept of “music autonomy” is a broad one, initially associated
            with Eduard Hanslick's idea of music as independent of external
            narratives or emotions (see <strong>Mark Evan Bonds</strong>,
            "Robert Zimmermann's 1854 Review of On the Musically Beautiful: A
            Translation and Commentary," in
            <em>The Aesthetic Legacy of Eduard Hanslick</em> (Routledge, 2024)).
            However, post-structuralist theorists have long argued that music
            cannot truly be autonomous, as it is inherently tied to cultural and
            social narratives (see, for example, <strong>Susan McClary</strong>,
            <em>Feminine Endings: Music, Gender, and Sexuality</em> (University
            of Minnesota Press, 2002)). In this context, the term “autonomy” may
            seem outdated. I prefer to use the term “semi-autonomy,” which
            refers to describe a type of musical organization that does not
            directly connect to an extra-musical narrative, such as a text or
            poem that dictates certain musical choices. Instead, a
            semi-autonomous musical organization emphasizes compositional
            developments which, of course, are always ultimately shaped by
            social and cultural norms and constrained by the pursuit of
            particular musical results. However, they are somehow detached —if
            this is ever truly possible— from the extramusical origin of the
            material.
          </span>
        </span>
        musical organization. In my music, the interplay between meaning,
        referentiality, and semi-autonomy is very dynamic and ever-changing;
        each piece develops its own criteria for balancing these elements.
        Perhaps a good example to understand what I mean here is the piece
        <em>Versificator – Render 3.</em> In it, the musical material consists
        of speech sounds, including nonsensical words in an imagined language.
        Conceptually, this is relatively easy to connect with the metaphor for
        the Versificator machine in Orwell's <em>1984</em>.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            <strong>Gerge Orwell</strong>,

            (Biblios, 2023)
          </span>
        </span>
        However, the organization of the material in time is mainly sound-based
        –or semi-autonomic from its extramusical background. The extra-musical
        connection that the material somehow traces usually remains as a loose
        metaphor and does not necessarily interfere with the musical logic of
        the compositional processes.
      </p>

      <h3>Extra-musical material</h3>
      <p>
        Music can coexist with or be conceived as part of a unified multimedia
        work. My musical thought is open to the inclusion of non-sonic mediums
        and spatial considerations, and it usually does so. This is particularly
        evident in the piece <em>Oscillations,</em> where music coexists with
        video projections.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of music coexisting with visual elements has a long tradition
        in WACM, especially in opera and opera-related works, where musical
        narratives are intertwined with staging and visual storytelling.
        However, different –and interesting– examples of music integrating
        visual aspects can be found in the works of composers such as Mauricio
        Kagel and Dieter Schnebel. These two composers –whose work has
        profoundly influenced me– are often associated with
        <em>instrumental musical theater</em> or <em>composed theater</em>.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            <strong>Matthias Rebstock</strong> and
            <strong>David Roesner</strong>,
            <em>Composed Theatre</em> (Intellect, 2012).
          </span>
        </span>
        In this tradition, visual elements are <em>composed</em> or
        conceptualized from a musical perspective. Furthermore, there is a large
        and growing field of practitioners within a domain known as “visual
        music”.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            See for example <strong>Brian Evans</strong>, "Foundations of a
            Visual Music," <em>Computer Music Journal</em> 29, no. 4 (2005),
            <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3681478" target="_blank"
              >http://www.jstor.org/stable/3681478</a
            >
            One notable practitioner in this field is the Argentine composer
            Ricardo Dal Farra.
          </span>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though in my practice, music almost always exists in interplay with
        other artistic mediums, I think musically, and I conceive my artistic
        narrative initially from a sonic perspective. Recently, however, I have
        faced some challenges to this way of creating, with the adoption in my
        practice of other than sonic mediums, such as algorithmic poetry and
        text. The nature of those challenges mainly has to do with difficulties
        in creating and integrating the two mediums into a common narrative, and
        for the first time, somehow, I have seen myself thinking more as a
        writer than as a composer.
      </p>

      <h3>Musical representation</h3>

      <p>
        My music is mainly score-based. This means that it is represented
        symbolically as a system of signs that equate to certain sonic
        parameters that are deemed as musical. Symbolic musical information,
        thus, refers to the representation of music typically using notation
        systems, such as the conventional musical score that stems from the
        Western tradition.
      </p>

      <p>
        There exists, however, another important dimension of symbolic
        representation of my music in connection with electronic music and CAC.
        This system is mainly based on the representation of musical parameters
        in a language that computers can understand: numbers.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            Historically, the most representative example of numerical musical
            formalization might be the
            <strong>MIDI protocol</strong>, which encodes pitch, duration, and
            velocity (dynamics) —among other metadata— into a computational
            representation in the form of binary numbers (bits and bytes). In
            computer-assisted composition workflows, numerical representations
            of musical parameters are often used to generate, manipulate, and
            control musical material and processes.
          </span>
        </span>
        I define this process of numeric representation of musical parameters to
        be operationalized computationally as <em>formalization.</em>
        However, formalization also occurs outside of the computer, or “outside
        of the system,” as these numeric systems usually fall short of
        encompassing all the possible musical dimensions involved in the
        creation of music, or the complexity of the processes involved in these
        acts it is not easily represented as computational expressions.
        Balancing musical representation, formalization, and communication is a
        crucial aspect I reflect on throughout my works.
      </p>

      <h3>Musical Space</h3>

      <p>
        Music happens in time. But also happens in space. The use of space for
        musical purposes has been a common practice since the Middle Ages and
        even before. Currently, the use of multiple speakers and sonic immersive
        spaces is relatively common in WACM. My work is not an exception to
        this. Even though my research does not delve into technical developments
        or even too deep into the usage of spatialization paradigms, the
        dimension of space is always present in the works.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea of musical space relates to my idea that music, when possible,
        benefits from a fully immersive experience. I have discussed this
        already concerning visual music and instrumental theater. Not only
        sound, video, and text can enhance a musical experience. Space, in
        addition, has the potential to give music a stronger communicational
        capacity. From triggering strong spatio-temporal associations in the
        listener to experiencing emotional or even physical sensations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is visible in my work <em>Oscillations,</em> where I use
        <em>soundscapes</em>.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            The term 'soundscape' gained popularity through the writings of R.
            Murray Schaffer and is generally understood as
            <em>
              an acoustic environment, often associated with cities, nature, or
              specific eras</em
            >
            See <strong>R. Murray Schafer,</strong
            ><em>
              The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the
              World</em
            >
            (Simon and Schuster, 1993), 111.
          </span>
        </span>
        as a means to immerse a listener into a different space, or time context
        –primarily connected to the wintry landscape of Schubert-Muller’s
        <em>Winterreise</em>– but also into another space-time connected to
        personal past recollections and imagination. While a soundscape is not
        inherently tied to a musical context, it can be used musically, as
        demonstrated in the works of Pierre Schaeffer and John Cage. However,
        the idea of soundscapes as non-musical sonic spaces raises questions
        about the boundaries between music, sound, noise, among many others.
        Addressing them would exceed the scope of this reflection. I adopt
        Murray Schafer’s perspective, viewing the <em>soundscape</em> as a
        blurring of the edges between music and environmental sounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        I mainly use the <em>Ambisonics</em> spatialization paradigm.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            <strong>David G. Malham and Anthony Myatt,</strong>

            >.
          </span>
        </span>
        Ambisonics is a spatial audio technique that captures, represents, and
        reproduces a three-dimensional sound field, allowing listeners to
        experience sound from all directions with precise localization. However,
        a deep or too technical discussion on sound and music spatializaion
        should be not expected, as it is not my strongest knowledge or focus.
      </p>

      <h3>Music composition as an artistic research practice</h3>

      <p>
        I understand the act of music composition as a process of artistic
        research. The question of composition as research has been broadly
        discussed, mainly from two antagonistic theses. The first claims that
        viewing musical composition as a form of research is a category error.
        Although there exists some previous writing on the matter, I will mainly
        refer to an article by the composer John Croft<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">

        responses to these responses.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">

        </span>
        The whole discussion around it encompasses several dimensions, such as
        philosophical, methodological, and ethical, and I believe that it
        greatly contributes to clarifying why I believe that music composition
        should be understood as a research practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        The defenders of the idea that music composition is not research argue
        reasons firstly relying on methodological inconsistencies with
        established academic research practices, such as the inutility of posing
        research questions or the fact that the outcome of composing is not
        generalizable, non-verifiable, and non-descriptive; secondly, a
        fundamentally philosophical understanding of artistic processes and
        their cognitive content as resistant to conceptualization:
        <em>
          presents rather than represents, discloses without describing, (as)
          such things can only be shown, not told.</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            <strong>Croft, </strong>"Composition is not research," 8.
          </span>
        </span>
        These authors propose that the cause for this miscategorization is the
        fact that, after being forcefully migrated to the world of universities,
        these practices were required to conform to academic regulations,
        including research protocols that initially were alien to them. In their
        opinion, composition as research is a symptom of the hollowed-out
        instrumentalism of academia today, and this is harmful to genuine
        musical originality.
      </p>

      <p>
        These claims can and have been challenged. To begin with, they seem to
        depart from the assumption that scientific research and its methods are
        the only valid research paradigm, and thus, artistic practices that, of
        course, don’t fit in should not be regarded as research. In this sense,
        the literature about research in humanities has already widely discussed
        the distinction between research in art and science, and fundamentally,
        the literature on artistic research has discussed extensively problems
        such as the production of knowledge in art, the role of the artistic
        practice in academia, and many other relevant issues that Croft –and
        others– seems to be unaware of.<span class="popover-container"

          we have to develop another way of discussing it. We have to develop an
          epistemology for the arts –an aesthetics, Baumgarten would say – new
          concepts and theories with which we can grasp that other way of

        Regarding the question of the methodological process, more precisely,
        about posing research questions, I am inclined to believe that
        proceeding this way is a personal choice and surely not right or wrong,
        but when one chooses to do it, it is obvious that responses to these
        questions that are not self-evident. It is possible to proceed by
        formulating theoretical or aesthetical assumptions –which could be very
        well posed as <em>hypotheses</em>– and the purpose of this compositional
        practice is to assess their sounding result, either confirming or
        refuting them –ideally– through an aesthetic judgment. Compositional
        inquiries expressed as research questions are answered through
        compositional practice, and doing so is a complex process that involves
        significant research efforts. Arriving at a resulting outcome is usually
        not a self-evident task, as it may involve multiple and multifaceted
        possibilities.

        It is fair to say at last that, for me, musical decisions should not be
        subject to empirical claims like scientific research. However, this
        doesn’t mean composition lacks evidence or criteria; research results in
        music can also be open to correction and refutation. Therefore, it is
        reasonable to expect that composers can articulate their inquiries,
        objectives, stages, and reflections. This articulation can inform others
        pursuing similar inquiries. Complementary to the idea of
        <em>another way of knowing</em> in artistic research, I believe that it
        is beneficial for composers to communicate how their work is constructed
        and why it is valuable, as this might contribute to the broader
        knowledge within the field.

          “Artistic research in the emphatic sense […] unites the artistic and
          the academic in an enterprise that impacts both domains. Art thereby
          transcends its former limits, aiming through the research to
          contribute to thinking and understanding; academia, for its part,
          opens up its boundaries to forms of thinking and understanding that
          are interwoven with artistic practices.”

        Approaching composition from an investigative point of view –as I
        believe has been the case for this project– is one approach rather than
        a categorical definition of what it means for composition to be artistic
        research. Within music, and especially composition, there are many
        different perspectives on what this process entails.<span

        Ultimately, in each of my compositions, an underlying inquisitive
        motivation is present, along with a desire to articulate technical and
        methodological aspects, develop potential contributions to the field,
        and explore more reflexive dimensions connected to the reception and
        social context of the work. I am hopeful that some might find my
        approach worthwhile as an artistic research practice.
