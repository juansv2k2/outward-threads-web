      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>
        This reflection is divided into three parts: the ‘Prelims,’ the
        ‘Artistic Result,’ and the ‘Afterwords.’ After this introduction and
        overview, the ‘Prelims’ section concludes with a lengthy chapter titled
        ‘Multidisciplinary Insights,’ which mainly provides theoretical concepts
        related to the project. This chapter can be seen as a kind of
        theoretical framework for the rest of the work, although I prefer not to
        label it as such, as that would place this reflection within the
        structure of a traditional doctoral dissertation, which, I believe, it
        is not.<span class="popover-container"

        In this section, I first discuss insights from cognitive sciences, basic
        concepts related to artificial intelligence, and the commonalities and
        differences between the two. I then situate my artistic practice within
        the context of Western art contemporary music, particularly intersecting
        with computer-assisted composition, in alignment with certain practices
        and outcomes expected in these fields. After exploring personal
        considerations on aspects of compositional practice, such as musical
        material, structure, musical representation, and musical space, I
        conclude with a reflection on music composition as an artistic research
        practice. A more detailed discussion of the field of practice for this
        project is reserved for the ‘Field of Practice’ subsection within the
        ‘Reflections’ chapter.
      </p>

      <p>
        As previously mentioned, the primary outcome of the project is artistic
        work. This consists of four distinct compositions:
        <em>Versificator – Render 3</em> for vocal quintet,
        <em>Elevator Pitch</em> for violoncello and electronics, the cycle of
        three pieces <em>Oscillations</em> for voices, ensemble, electronics and
        visuals, and <em>I am a Strange Loop</em> for saxophone quartet, reeds
        duo and electronics. Each of these works is examined in detail across
        four chapters in the ‘Artistic Result’ section.
      </p>

      <p>
        I propose a three-fold perspective for exploring these works. First, to
        investigate the genesis of each in the light of a paradigm for human
        cognition. The aim will be to establish connections between theories
        that explain the thought process that potentially prevails for each
        piece and its constructive aspects. Secondly, from an analytical
        perspective, focusing on the compositional methods, and
        musical-technical aspects. This approach builds on the previous one by
        drawing analogies between certain thought processes, creative
        methodologies and computational implementations. Finally, from a
        contextual perspective, linking each piece’s source of inspiration with
        its conceptual and experiential aspects, with a particular focus on the
        communicative and expressive intentions behind each work. Additionally,
        alongside a technical description of specific creative methodologies, I
        include examples of relevant musical works, primarily by contemporary
        composers who have previously developed some of these methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each composition is mainly explored through one of these three models of
        cognition: the cognitivist paradigm, the connectionist approach, and the
        embodied perspective. Additionally, the concept of
        <em>abstraction</em> is introduced as a synthesizing framework that
        unifies these approaches. The cognitivist paradigm is paralleled with
        symbolic AI and methods like constraint satisfaction programming (CSP),
        while the connectionist paradigm aligns with sub-symbolic systems and
        methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN).<span

            This taxonomy of AI methods for music composition has been proposed
            by
            <strong>Jose David Fernández</strong> and
            <strong>Francisco Vico</strong>, "AI Methods in Algorithmic

        Within the ‘Artistic Result,’ these distinct computational approaches
        are used as creative tools in a computer-assisted composition workflow,
        but they also extend to other artistic forms, like algorithmic
        poetry.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            Algorithmic poetry is a form of literature where poems are generated
            according to a set of pre-determined rules or processes, often with
            the use of a computer program. In 2020, I took the course
            “Algorithmic Poetry” taught by the Mexican artist
            <strong>Mario Guzman</strong>, which was greatly influential for the
            development of the whole project, in connection to the creation of
            algorithmic text experiments that inspired some of the works that I
            created during this research time. More on Mario in

      <p>
        An important part of the research consists of examining compositional
        formalizations at both computational and non-computational levels,
        something that I discuss as composing “inside the system” and “outside
        the system,” respectively. Composing inside the system focuses on using
        computational methods to generate and develop musical material and
        explore forms of musical organization. In contrast, composing outside
        the system essentially investigates subjective creative responses to
        these methods: something that cannot be computationally operationalized
        and emerges as a force that interplays with these formalizations. The
        investigation of these two approaches results in reflections on how they
        take form, how they coexist within my creative process, whether these
        find some meeting points or common ground, and, when possible, how the
        navigation through an intermediate territory unfolds. Addressing these
        issues is an important part of the process, and some answers to these
        questions can be found in each of the ‘Final Reflection’ subsections for
        each of the pieces.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ‘Afterwords’ part of this text comprises two chapters: ‘Reflections’
        and ‘Conclusions?’. In the first chapter, I delve into personal
        reflections on broad ethical perspectives that I believe might be
        relevant for other composers to consider. Within the sections ‘The
        Question of Contemporary Music’ and ‘Ethics of a Compositional
        Practice,’ I offer my view on topics such as the political implications
        of music composition, the role of the composer in society, and the
        function of this type of music within societal frameworks. These
        reflections form a key part of the project’s outcomes, influencing not
        only the creative process but also the purpose and societal impact of
        the resulting artwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe it is important to address the current context of my practice
        in light of recent technological developments in the field of artificial
        intelligence, particularly generative AI (gen-AI).<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            gen-AI is a very hot and trendy topic nowadays. See for example the
            “words of the year 2023” by some of the most important dictionaries
            involve terms related to AI and gen-AI. See for example
            <a
              href="https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/word-of-the-year-2023-different-dictionaries-1703663520-1"
              >https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/word-of-the-year-2023-different-dictionaries-1703663520-1</a
            >.
          </span>
        </span>
        Alongside reflections on general ethical considerations in the practice
        of composing, it is essential to examine specific ethical issues related
        to the use of gen-AI, a technology that plays a significant role in this
        project. In the chapter ‘Composition and gen-AI,’ I discuss ethical
        considerations surrounding authorship, ownership, and copyright from a
        historical perspective, as well as relatively new issues posed by the
        use of this technology in music, and in arts in general. Additionally, I
        speculate about the evolving role of artists within these new generative
        paradigms as well as providing visions about the future of artistic
        practice, that I view as key to understanding the new creative
        territories this technology opens for exploration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later, I will discuss the field of practice of my work in relation to
        its historical development: a current phase in the development of
        Western art contemporary music has long moved beyond the frameworks of
        <em>modernity</em> and <em>postmodernity.</em> This period, sometimes
        referred to by theorists as Late –or Second– Modernity, remains
        relevant, as many of its key practitioners are still active and have
        ongoing careers in the mainstream scene in Western countries. I include
        examples of some practitioners and works from which I have drawn
        inspiration. However, I speculate that this period is nearing its end
        and transitioning into something else, which some authors define as
        <em>Post-contemporary.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        At the intersection of this field, I place the field of
        computer-assisted composition, which has a rich history of research
        dating back at least to the late 1950s, when these methods first
        emerged. There is not only a significant history of technical and
        artistic developments that form the backdrop of this project but also a
        dynamic and continually evolving field. In this section, I offer a
        succinct overview of the ideas and works of historical practitioners who
        have had a profound influence on my compositional thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        The closing chapter, ‘Conclusions?’, presents final reflections on key
        issues addressed in this project, along with a discussion of its
        potential contributions. Regarding the latter, the development of my
        musical works throughout this project prompted me to implement, refine,
        and further develop several computational methodologies as compositional
        tools, primarily through computer-assisted composition functions and
        libraries. I believe an important contribution of this project lies in
        these developments, which are discussed in the section ‘Contributions.’
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, I offer some closing remarks, which focus on how the project
        could bridge gaps between neurocognitive and practice-based approaches,
        the tensions between creativity and institutionalized practices, and the
        role of formalizations as well as the aspects that lie beyond them. I
        also outline potential research threads for further exploration in the
        near future.
      </p>

      <h3>Research Inquiries</h3>

      <p>
        As the development of this project’s artistic outcomes has progressed,
        numerous artistic inquiries have arisen. Many of these have been
        explored in profundity, and the process has been described –more or
        less– in detail. Other inquiries remain more as open questions that
        don’t necessarily find an answer in the form of a musical work or
        written reflections; rather, they act more as catalysts for more
        specific or goal-oriented creative explorations. While it is impossible
        to encompass every question that has occupied my thoughts since I began
        with this project, below, I have attempted to generalize and summarize
        some overarching research threads and inquiries that have emerged
        throughout the process. Additionally, many more specific creative
        questions and technical investigations are posed within the discussion
        of each individual composition.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          To what extent can we analytically describe the human creative process
          in music composition using theories of human cognition and
          computational creativity frameworks?
        </li>
        <li>
          Could this understanding influence our artistic agency and creative
          processes?
        </li>
        <li>
          How do computational frameworks interact with the subjective aspects
          of musical creativity?
        </li>

        <li>
          How can the boundaries and blurred spaces between human creativity and
          computational agency be explored?
        </li>
        <li>
          How can this interplay foster genuine and relevant artistic questions?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Other inquiries, particularly those related to ethical aspects of a
        compositional practice and the social, cultural, and historical
        implications of using artificial intelligence as a method for artistic
        creation, are broad and profound, largely exceeding the scope of this
        text. Therefore, these topics are approached more as a practice of
        reflection, for which I have offered a personal perspective, striving to
        keep it as updated and informed as possible, especially regarding the
        latter questions.
