      <h2>The Embodied Perspective</h2>
      <hr />

      <div class="synopsis">
        <p>
          Philosopher Hartmut Rosa suggests that our society is characterized by
          acceleration due to rapid technological advancements, leading to
          constant time shortages. As we adapt to quick updates via smartphones
          and social media, communication becomes faster and more fragmented,
          favoring brief, direct forms like the elevator pitch. An elevator
          pitch is a short summary speech meant to convey ideas or products
          within the duration of an elevator ride. It is aimed at being clear
          and persuasive to a wide audience. In politics, new communication
          techniques exploit these brief, impactful messages, often
          oversimplifying complex issues and lacking depth. Such strategies have
          been criticized for manipulating public opinion and stirring emotions,
          leading to biased and divisive rhetoric that can aid authoritarian or
          intolerant movements. The piece <em>Elevator Pitch</em> poses an
          artistic focus on these contemporary methods of communication –such as
          an elevator pitch– and the potential for manipulation of sound-bite
          content by political figures. The piece thus is a sardonic analogy to
          a political speech, which is portrayed here as empty of substance, and
          as a construct derived from a carefully crafted algorithmic rhetoric.

      <h3>The Isolated Mind?</h3>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “[The mind] arises from the nature of our brains, bodies, and bodily
          experiences. This is not just the innocuous and obvious claim that we
          need a body to reason; rather, it is the striking claim that the very
          structure of reason itself comes from the details of our embodiment…
          Thus, to understand reason, we must understand the details of our
          visual system, our motor system, and the general mechanism of neural
          binding.”

        Cognitivism and connectionism, despite their distinct approaches, share
        the assumption of an independent external reality that needs to be
        represented internally by the mind. Our mind interacts with the external
        world through these internal representations in the form of symbols, as
        in cognitivism or learned patterns in connectionism. Both of these
        systems focus on the internal complexities of the mind and seem to
        disregard the physical medium through which all the information reaches
        our cognition, which is the initial point of all of our sensory
        reception: our body. Cognitivism and connectionism, according to Andy
        Clark, seem to operate in isolation<span class="popover-container"

        from the external world, relying only on its mental representation.
      </p>

      <h4>Embodied Cognition</h4>
      <p>
        The concept of <em>embodied cognition</em> has emerged as a response to
        these views and essentially poses that cognition is rooted in our
        physical existence and interaction with the environment. Our
        understanding of concepts and the world, thus, is grounded in bodily
        experiences and sensorimotor interactions.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            The idea that cognition is not solely intellectual but involves the
            body’s active engagement with the world has strong historical roots
            in philosophy. In particular, Spinoza’s philosophy provides an early
            foundation for ideas that align with modern concepts of embodied
            cognition. In his system, mind and body are not separate substances
            but two attributes of the same underlying substance, which he
            identifies as God or Nature <em>(Deus sive Natura).</em> Spinoza’s
            idea proposes that mental and physical states mirror each other:
            changes in the body correspond to changes in the mind, implying that
            cognition is deeply influenced by bodily interactions with the
            world. Spinoza also views emotions as bodily responses to external
            stimuli that affect the mind, further linking cognitive processes to
            the body’s state. While Spinoza did not develop a comprehensive
            theory of embodied cognition in the contemporary sense, his work
            anticipates key ideas in this field, particularly the
            interconnectedness of mind, body, and knowledge. See Steven Nadler,
            <em>Spinoza's 'Ethics' : An Introduction</em> (Cambridge, UNITED
            KINGDOM: Cambridge University Press, 2006).
          </span>
        </span>
        From the <em>embodied</em> perspective, thus, cognition arises from the
        continuous interplay between the brain, body, and external world, moving
        beyond the internalized focus of <em>cognitivism</em> and
        <em>connectionism.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some key theorists in the field of embodied cognition include Clarence
        Barsalou, George Lakoff, and Mark Johnson. Despite some nuances among
        their views, these researchers generally agree that advanced cognitive
        abilities rely on the re-enactment of sensory and motor experiences.
        This means that <em>semantic knowledge</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            <em>Semantic knowledge</em> encompasses general knowledge about
            concepts, their relationships, and how they are meaningfully
            connected.
          </span>
        </span>
        depends on sensorimotor representations. The neural systems that play a
        role in forming and accessing semantic knowledge are the same systems
        used when we perceive sensory stimuli or perform actions. Essentially,
        our higher mental processes<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            <em>Higher mental processes</em> are any of the more complex types

        originally used for understanding sensory input or executing actions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ideas around embodied cognition rely on two key concepts:
        <em>dynamic systems</em> theory and <em>enaction.</em> Regarding the
        first, it is proposed that cognition arises from self-organizing,
        dynamic systems through the non-linear, circular causality of continuous
        sensorimotor interactions involving the brain, body, and environment. A
        metaphor representing this idea is the mind as
        <em>
          an embodied dynamic system in the world rather than the mind as a
          neural network in the head</em
        >.<span class="popover-container"

          </span>
        </span>
        From this perspective, cognition is best understood through
        <em>dynamic systems theory,</em> which models changes in a system’s
        state over time using <em>differential equations.</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            In mathematics, a differential equation is a formula that connects
            one or more unknown functions with their derivatives. In practical
            applications, the functions typically represent physical quantities,
            while the derivatives describe their rates of change. The
            differential equation establishes the relationship between these
            quantities and their rates of change. in

        The idea of enaction emphasizes that living beings are autonomous
        agents, actively generating and sustaining themselves while enacting
        their own cognitive domains. As a dynamic and autonomous system, the
        nervous system generates coherent and meaningful patterns of activity
        through circular and reentrant interactions among neurons. Rather than
        merely processing information computationally, the nervous system
        creates meaning. Moreover, the world of a cognitive being is not an
        external reality internally represented by the brain but a relational
        domain enacted through the being’s autonomous agency and interactions
        with the environment.<span class="popover-container"

        Most theorists on embodied cognition emphasize the crucial role of
        <em>simulation</em> in understanding concepts.<span

        This view suggests that accessing semantic knowledge involves the same
        neural systems active during perception or action, requiring these
        systems to replicate the processes used during initial perception or
        action. Neuroscientific evidence supporting this claim emerged notably
        with the discovery of mirror neurons. These neurons activate when a
        specific movement is performed or observed in others. Mirror neurons,
        thus, are strongly linked to our process of learning actions through
        imitation and ultimately to our understanding of concepts.<span

        Some authors have broadened the idea of <em>simulation</em> to encompass
        more general cognitive applications. For instance, George Lakoff and
        Mark Johnson suggest that our cognition evolves and grows through
        metaphors derived from the physical world,<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*

          </span>
        </span>
        as we constantly use metaphors to assimilate physical experiences into
        our comprehension of abstract concepts. But what exactly is a
        <em>metaphor?</em> A metaphor is a figure of speech in which a word or
        phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally
        applicable.<span class="popover-container"
          >*

            2024).
          </span>
        </span>
        A metaphor, therefore, is a figurative expression that implies a
        conceptual connection between two domains that suggests broad
        similarities between these two. Embodied cognition utilizes the idea of
        metaphor as the loose mapping of one conceptual field onto another,
        proposing that we think in constant metaphors by importing the physical
        and experiential into our understanding of the pure and abstract.
        Metaphors function conceptually, enabling a way of reasoning rather than
        merely as a linguistic tool. The metaphor, thus, is central to
        reasoning, and most metaphors, ultimately, are rooted in physical and
        social experiences.

      <p>
        However, the explanations provided by embodied cognition theorists seem
        insufficient to fully capture the complexities of cognition. A major
        criticism is that embodied perspectives struggle to explain the
        acquisition of abstract concepts<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">

        or the creation of novel ideas that cannot be directly simulated from
        prior embodied experiences. This is particularly relevant to certain
        forms of creativity: How does <em>embodiment</em> influence mathematical
        creativity, for instance?<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">

          </span></span

        Or, in the context of musical creativity, how do embodied experiences or
        metaphoric thinking contribute to the use of counterpoint for composing
        a fugue, or to the composition of dodecaphonic music?<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            <em>Dodecaphonic</em> music, also known as twelve-tone music, is a
            method of musical composition that uses all twelve notes of the
            chromatic scale in a specific, recurring order. Unlike the tonal
            system, where certain notes and chords embody different degrees of
            tension and resolution, notes or chords in the dodecaphonic system
            do not convey a sense of tonal attraction. Instead, the perceived
            level of dissonance is consistently high, and hierarchies between
            notes cannot be easily traced. This technique was developed by
            Arnold Schoenberg in the early 20th century and later adopted by
            some of his students. In its strictest form, dodecaphonic music
            developed into <em>total serialism,</em> a method of composition
            that became almost prescriptive for the most relevant European and
            American composers around the mid-20th century.

        </span>
        Beyond obvious physical constraints like audible frequency ranges,
        instrumental limitations, analogies with human voices and melodic lines,
        and so on, can musical creative ideas be explained only by the embodied
        experience of music? The answers to these questions are not so
        straightforward.

      <h4>Composing with the Body</h4>
      <p>
        How does embodied cognition manifest in a compositional process? As I
        felt moved to investigate more about this, to understand better what the
        implications are within my creative practice, I discovered the very
        interesting work of a scholar from the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki. Ula
        Pohannoro investigates the material and physical aspects of
        compositional thinking. At the beginning of the article, she claims
        that:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Within musical practice, composing is considered the mental,
          intellectual, and creative form of musical practice, par excellence.
          In contrast, the work of a performer seems to be substantially
          practical, reproductive, and corporeal. […] Working in the solitary
          studio of a Western art music score-based composer—notwithstanding the
          intellectual nature of their compositional activities—is in almost
          every instant grounded in materialities of different kinds and
          attained by non-propositional practical understanding. This practical
          understanding originates in the material and physical aspects of sound
          and the action of producing that sound. It manifests itself in the way
          the producers of sounds and timbres, such as the performers with their
          movements and instruments, persist in the working mind of a composer.
          Moreover, creative thinking entails bodily activity by the composer,
          which transpires in the form of an intuitive mode of reasoning.”

        The article essentially aims to challenge the idea that composition is
        an exclusively intellectual task. It argues that a composition or score
        inherently includes material elements that require and lay the
        groundwork for physical action. Pohjannoro further discusses the idea of
        materiality and physicality in composition research and brings a case
        study as evidence to support her claims.<span class="popover-container"

            It is important to note that the author proposed the same case of
            study to discuss the compositional process in light of the two types
            of creative thought that I discussed earlier in this text: the
            rational and the intuitive. This later article seems to expand the
            same case of study into a new framework in which the embodiment of
            the process takes an unprecedentedly important role. See
            <strong> Ulla Pohjannoro, </strong> "Inspiration and
            decision-making: A case study of a composer's intuitive and
            reflective thought," <em>Musicae Scientiae</em> 18, no. 2 (2014),

        The author concludes that the materiality of the process deeply
        connected to the embodied experience should complement, rather than
        replace, the other two paradigms, the symbolic and the connectionist.

            From these earlier discussions, a natural question arises: how do
            embodiment, materiality, and physical constraints manifest in my
            compositional practice? To explore this, I will examine the creative
            process behind the piece <em>Elevator Pitch</em> for violoncello and
            electronics, aiming to better understand these aspects and how they
            interact with my creative methods and the overall conceptual vision
            for the piece.
