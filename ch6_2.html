      <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>

      <p>
        The piece <em>Elevator Pitch</em> has a long story. Of all the pieces
        that I wrote for this project, and probably in my life, this is the one
        that changed the most from its original idea to its final result.
        Initially, the piece was conceived to investigate how rhetorical figures
        could be translated intointo musical rules that would develop into a
        musical narrative.

      <h4>Musical Procedural Rhetoric</h4>
      <p>
        Since antiquity, the study of rhetoric has been considered as a set of
        skills aimed at achieving a more persuasive manner of speaking and
        writing. The effectiveness of rhetorical communication is often achieved
        through linguistic devices collectively known as
        <em>rhetorical figures</em> or <em>figures of speech.</em> These devices
        rely on ornamental discursive techniques that convey meanings or
        functions beyond their literal interpretation. Examples include
        <em>simile,</em> <em>metaphor,</em> <em>allegory,</em>
        <em>hyperbole,</em> <em>irony,</em> <em>antithesis,</em>
        <em>metonymy,</em> <em>synecdoche,</em> <em>prosopopoeia,</em>
        <em>apostrophe,</em> <em>climax,</em> <em>incrementum,</em> and
        <em>exclamation,</em> among many others.<span class="popover-container"

        The notion of music rhetoric has a long history in Western music, in
        particular in composers from the Renaissance and Baroque periods. During
        these periods, composers often incorporated elements of rhetoric in
        their works, as they viewed an intrinsic connection between the rhetoric
        of language and the capability of music to stir and evoke emotions in
        listeners through the use of <em>affects</em>.<span
          class="popover-container"
        >
          *<span class="popover-content">
            <em>Affects</em> have been defined as emotional abstractions or
            <em>idealized emotional states</em> that a composer was expected to
            arouse in the listener through a musical work.
          </span>
        </span>
        Composers like Claudio Monteverdi demonstrated a profound understanding
        of the relationship between music and text in vocal compositions.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            In 1605, Monteverdi introduced the distinction between the
            <em>prima prattica</em> and the <em>seconda prattica,</em> or first
            and second practices, something that marked a shift in composition,
            moving from an established style to a more modern approach.
          </span>
        </span>
        Similarly, composers of instrumental music drew inspiration from
        rhetorical principles to describe and refine their compositional
        techniques. For example, certain musical gestures, such as melodic
        repetition, fugal imitation, dissonance or consonance, intervallic
        movement patterns, and even silence, were viewed as formulas widely
        applicable in diverse musical contexts:

        However, for this piece, the use of algorithms and computational methods
        to do this would move this process closer to the idea of
        <em>procedure</em> or <em>procedural.</em> An important concept is the
        idea of <em>procedural rhetoric,</em> developed by Ian Bogost.<span

        This term refers to the idea that processes, especially the ones used in
        computing, are means of persuasion. In this light, computational
        algorithms represented in computer code are viewed as rhetoric agents
        from a perspective based on <em>procedure</em> as a form of facilitating
        action. Eventually, I ended up developing a conceptual framework for
        some of the constructive aspects of the piece that I termed
        <em>musical procedural rhetoric,</em> which linked the implementation of
        rule-based formulations using constraint algorithms for the composition
        of music as instances of procedural expression.<span

        I wanted to link this constructive idea to a type of contemporary
        political communication, and how certain politicians make use of a kind
        of an “artificial” rhetoric to generate highly emotional and
        performative speeches that have the effect of driving opinion and,
        ultimately, manipulating thought. I became inspired by an idea discussed
        by philosopher Hartmut Rosa, who characterizes modern society as an
        <em>accelerated society</em>.<span class="popover-container">

        He proposes that the latest groundbreaking technological advancements
        have resulted in an accelerated pace of life, ultimately leading to the
        experience of a chronic shortage of time. In such an environment,
        communications are consumed instantaneously through smartphones and
        social media, promoting a paradigm where communicational brevity and
        succinctness are essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has given rise to discursive techniques like the elevator pitch, a
        brief speech designed to quickly convince listeners of a value
        proposition for a product, idea, or project. These new strategies have
        migrated into political communication, where they are used to craft
        messages that manipulate public opinion by providing selective
        information on pressing social issues like immigration and minority
        rights, often linked to authoritarian, autocratic, and intolerant
        political movements. The piece, thus, aims to be a sardonic analogy to a
        political speech, which is portrayed here as empty of substance and as
        an artificial construct of a computational “laboratory-made” rhetoric,
        relying purely on historical conventional rhetorical strategies.

      <p>
        At the beginning of the ideation of the piece, I had in mind to
        investigate three main inquiries. Firstly, as the piece is inspired by
        this so-called type of computational “laboratory-made” rhetoric, I
        imagined a musical narrative that would use speech or spoken sound
        material as departure points for deriving musical material and operating
        compositional processes related to rhetoric figures. This is by no means
        a new or novel thing to do.<span class="popover-container">
          *
          <span class="popover-content">
            A well-known contemporary composer who has explored this approach is
            Jonathan Harvey. More recently, Fabio Cifariello Ciardi has
            developed a system to translate speech prosody as musical material.
            I will discuss some of their works in the section ‘Symbolic
            Sonification.’
          </span>
        </span>
        However, I sought to investigate a way of doing this so that the music
        would relate strongly to the backdrop of the piece: the musical speech
        needed to evoke a political narrative, somehow giving the impression
        that the cello itself had become a political figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, looking into the possibilities of using constraint algorithms
        to govern the organization of idiomatic techniques and sound production
        types for the violoncello. A strong motivation for this was to explore
        ways of involving qualitative or <em>weak</em
        ><span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content">
            The concept of weak musical parameters is not universally accepted.
            However, the parameters often considered most potent are pitch,
            rhythm, and dynamics, with articulation sometimes viewed as a more
            subtle or nuanced aspect of music expression. Initially, the
            dominance of pitch and rhythm as the primary musical compositional
            domains throughout the history of Western music was addressed
            critically by James Tenney in the early 1960s, as he proposed that
            every musical parameter could hold structural importance within a
            musical phrase. See <strong>James Tenney, </strong>"Meta (+) Hodos:
            A Phenomenology of Twentieth Century Musical Materials and an
            Approach to the Study of Form" (Frog Peak Music, 1968). However, in
            computer-assisted composition, I believe that the issue of
            hierarchical formalizations persists, and I believe that further
            compositional research toward formalizations of diverse musical
            parameters is desired.
          </span>
        </span>
        musical parameters at an important compositional level, possibly not any
        less than pitch and rhythm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I wanted to create some nonsensical text that would follow
        –somehow– the same constraint rules used for the musical organization.
        This text would be part of the piece, either as vocalized by the
        performer or as synthetic speech in the electronic part. In the end, I
        leaned on this latter approach, which I will discuss in detail later.
      </p>

      <h4>Musical Material and Form</h4>
      <p>
        The musical material is mainly derived from the musical translation of a
        speech fragment from Donald Trump. I analyzed the opening phrase of
        Trump’s inaugural speech as president of the United States<span

        Formally, the piece is constructed as a linear flow of musical phrases
        that develop according to a –rather metaphoric– implementation of
        rhetoric figures, as they were described by the classic
        <em>Quadripartite Ratio</em>.<span class="popover-container">
          *
          <span class="popover-content">
            The <em>Quadripartite Ratio</em> is a rhetorical framework that
            dates back to classical rhetoric in Ancient Greece, often associated
            with Hermogenes of Tarsus. In it, the different types of rhetorical
            actions are described and categorized into four basic operations:
            <em>adiectio, detractio, immutatio, </em>and<em> transmutatio.</em>
            <em>Adiectio</em> refers to the addition of information to
            strengthen a particular point, often by organizing words or clauses
            to build intensity. <em>Detractio</em> involves omitting details to
            highlight other elements of the argument.
            <em>Immutatio</em> rearranges the order of words or phrases, and
            <em>transmutatio</em> changes the structure or form of words while
            keeping their meaning the same.
          </span>
        </span>
        In connection to the rhetoric idea, I chose an archetypical musical form
        for this piece, related to the Aristotelian concept of narrative.<span
          class="popover-container"
        >
          *
          <span class="popover-content">
            Some authors have discussed the persuasive power of the Aristotelian
            narrative and how it has been applied to various forms of
            communication, from fiction to product pitches. See for example
            <strong>Odile Sullivan-Tarazi, </strong>"Narrative insights: notes

          </span>
        </span>
        Ultimately, in this type of narrative structure, there is a logical
        chain of cause and effect where earlier events are related to current
        events and will be perceived as connected to future developments. Of
        course, I aimed to represent that musically in the way of developing the
        material throughout the piece.

        The piece begins with breath sounds presented in the electronics, a
        sound that proposes a type of inward-outward gesture and an interruption
        of the flow towards the end (halted inhaling, silence, and irregular
        exhaling). This gesture is important and will keep developing throughout
        the piece as the seed for processes of expansion, compression, and
        interruptions of the flow. For example, the inward-outward gesture
        becomes the seed for the posterior process of expansion of melodic
        profiles, metaphorically related to the equivalent rhetoric processes of
        <em>adiectio</em> (or <em>auxesis)</em> from the
        <em>Quadripartite Ratio:</em>

      <p>
        The gesture of interruption becomes evident within the narrative as
        certain musical flows are abruptly cut and juxtaposed with contrastive
        elements. It is possible to see, especially from m. 96, when the
        appoggiaturas start breaking the flow in increasingly shorter periods,
        and in the final section.

        After the highest energetic point of the piece in m. 125, the final
        section takes on a bluesy tone. The narrative flow is disrupted by an
        overpressed C<sub>2</sub> plus silence, leading to a breakdown of
        continuity by the end of the piece. Intertwined throughout these phrases
        is a sonic gesture created by rubbing the back of the cello’s
        fingerboard with a superball, producing a vocal-like sound that
        corresponds with the nonsensical speech elements in the electronics (the
        electronic component will be discussed in greater detail later).

        Throughout the piece, the rhetorical categories of
        <em>immutatio</em> and <em>transmutatio</em> translate into structural
        aspects related to the unfolding of different types of instrumental
        techniques and idiomatic sound production types for the violoncello,
        such as <em>pitch bending, tremolo,</em> and
        <em>vertical bowing tremolo.</em> For this, I used two Lisp rules that
        metaphorically align with the figures of <em>immutatio</em> and
        <em>transmutatio,</em> expressed as two logical statements in the LISP
        code that are enforced by the constraint engine. The first rule involves
        the repetition of elements within a list (at the level of gestures, or
        words), while the second enforces repetition across consecutive pairs of
        lists (phrases).<span class="popover-container">

            These rules exist originally in the CAC library JBSconstraints,
            developed by the composer J. B. Schillingi. For some time, I studied
            B. Schillingi’s rules as well as other rules by Ö. Sandred and J.
            Vincenot as a method to learn the syntax programming language Lisp,
            which was not familiar to me before. Ultimately, I ended up writing
            my own versions of these rules as a learning process.

        Notice how rule (a) observes that in each list, only two elements
        repeat, and the rest are different. In the second rule (b), only two
        elements are repeated across consecutive lists, and within each list,
        the rest of the elements are different. As an example, consider the
        bowing position. Here the candidates have been restricted to
        <em>ordinario</em> (‘ord.’), <em>sul ponticello</em> (‘sul pont.’),
        <em> sul tasto </em> (‘sul tasto’), and the possible trajectories
        between them. The rule, thus, enforces that two bowing positions should
        be repeated every consecutive four.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems to be an easily doable task “by hand,” so the question might
        be, why do I write code rules to do this? There’s a good answer to that.
        As more musical parameters become constrained simultaneously, the
        combinatorial possibilities increase enormously and it soon becomes a
        task only doable with the assistance of a computer. The table below
        schematically shows how the constraint engine generates a musical
        sequence by constraining three musical dimensions:
        <em>rhythm, bowing position,</em> and <em>bowing pressure.</em>

      <p>
        Here, the three parameters are constrained in a cascade fashion: the
        first dimension –rhythm– follows a permutational rule, and the
        candidates for the rest of the voices are constrained to certain
        rhythmic figures. For example, longer bowing trajectories (for example,
        sul pont. to sul tasto) can only occur in whole- and half-notes. Static
        bowing trajectories (for example, sul pont., ord., sul tasto) are
        restricted to quarter- and eight-notes, and intermediate trajectories
        occur only in half- and quarter notes. In addition, the unfolding of
        bowing positions and bow pressure is constrained by the rules (a) and
        (b) discussed above. The result is a complex, multilayered construct
        where independent parameters are organized through simultaneous
        constraint rules that establish relationships among them:

        Now, I will move to the electronic part of the piece, which is where the
        nonsensical speech comes in. Since I had already been experimenting with
        the rule-based text generation for the piece
        <em>Versificator – Render 3,</em> I thought I could somehow expand on
        this methodology. Ultimately, the problem –or the reality– that I faced
        in <em>Versificator – Render 3</em> was related essentially to the hyper
        complexity of human language and the impossibility of modeling it based
        on a few constraint rules. Of course, it was never my idea to do this.
        Rather, I used the constraint rules as a metaphor and a tool for
        automated generation, but clearly, the resulting text was quite simple.

      <p>
        From that point on, I wondered how to move into a deeper level of

        but over which I should have some control. Then, suddenly, it hit me:
        Markov Chains! I knew about Markov Chains from before in my life.
        However, I never experimented with them until 2021 for my piece
        <em>Isovell Che Segila Chentellare</em> for eight voices. The process of
        composition of <em>Isovell</em> was rather fast and unsatisfactory.
        However, it was a good starting point to investigate the Markovian
        generation of text in my next pieces, in particular for
        <em>Elevator Pitch</em> and also for <em>Oscillations (i).</em>

      <h5>Markov Chains</h5>

      <p>
        Markov Chains (MCs) were first theorized by the Russian mathematician
        Andrei Markov in 1906. A MC is a probabilistic model describing a
        sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event
        depends only on the state attained in the previous event. MCs are based
        on the analysis of consecutive events or <em>states.</em> In other
        words, a Markov model learns from some data by looking at how likely it
        is for an event to come after some other –or how likely it is for an
        event to come after two others, or three, and so on. For this reason,
        MCs have been used extensively to observe linguistic regularities and
        patterns. In fact, Markov initially used this method to observe
        tendencies of spelling in the written Russian language, using the text
        <em>Eugene Onegin</em> by Alexander Pushkin as a model.<span

        In music, the use of MCs has mainly served two purposes. On the one
        hand, analytic, as MCs can provide a descriptive analysis of the
        probabilities of a set of musical elements occurring in a sequence.
        Thus, they have served as a tool for musical analysis of regularities in
        style, for example. On the other hand, generative, as they facilitate a
        simple computational generative process following the probabilities
        learned from a model. As the probability distribution of events of the
        new data follows that of the original, it will have some resemblance
        with it. MCs have been used, for example, for generating jazz
        improvisations,<span class="popover-container"

        At some point around the late 1980s and early 1990s, MCs became
        old-fashioned and ceased to interest composers. Since then, and from
        what I could investigate, there have been very few approaches to using
        MCs as a serious compositional tool. However, two of them greatly

        After finding out about these attempts to create
        <em>steerable</em> Markovian models, namely, Markov generators that can
        be compositionally controlled to a certain extent, I decided to pursue
        this method for a more serious artistic purpose. I began to investigate
        the implementation of a steered Markovian generation process facilitated
        by the combination of constraint algorithms and MCs by using a Markov
        model as a constraint rule. This method thus would facilitate the
        creation of the –long-advertised– nonsensical text in the piece
        <em>Elevator Pitch,</em> and experimenting with different ways of
        steering it became a strong motivation.
      </p>

      <h5>Steered Markovian Generation</h5>
      <p>
        The electronics in <em>Elevator Pitch</em> consist mainly of steered
        Markovian text. The source for the Markov model for the text is the same
        speech by Donald Trump from where I got the source for the sonification
        that originates the musical material. To generate this text, I combined
        constraint algorithms with a MC. In practice, the constraint algorithm
        uses a Markovian transition table as a constraint rule. This means that
        the constraint engine checks that every combination of candidates –the
        candidates are letters or syllables, depending on the order of the MC–
        is represented as a transition state in the Markov matrix. For this, I
        developed a Max abstraction that I termed MarkovConstraints, which I
        will discuss later in the chapter ‘Conclusions?,’ in the section
        ‘Contributions.’

        As constraint rules are feasible to be chained, Markov rules can be
        combined with other constraint rules, for example, patterns of rhyme and
        alliteration<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"

            endings don’t imply alliteration or rhyming—and vice versa—in the
            English language. This issue has been addressed in a different
            piece, in which this same process was done using the IPA alphabet.
            In that case, the correspondence between symbols and sounds is
            univocal. In any case, the result using the Latin alphabet was not
            so far from what I expected.</span

        –as I used in the piece <em>Versificator – Render 3,</em> or poetic
        structures (number of syllables and verses). As a result of this, the
        nonsensical text in <em>Elevator Pitch</em> is far more complex –and
        sometimes more realistic– than the one generated using solely
        conventional constraint rules in <em>Versificator – Render 3.</em>

        The example below was created using a 1st-order MC in combination with a
        constraint rule that enforces that, for every four letters, two should
        be repeated and two different. The resulting text follows a 1st-order
        Markov probability matrix of Trump’s speech but at the same time follows
        the aforementioned rule:

        In the following example, I created five shorter words using the same
        rules discussed above, but I added a rule that constrains the text
        output to have a determined ending rhyme pattern (abab). The time that
        took the algorithm to find solutions became considerably longer:
      </p>

      Daldlydy<strong>oy</strong> (a)<br />
      Gefeoene<strong>an</strong> (b)<br />
      Puspsosy<strong>oy</strong> (a)<br />
      Olsosasn<strong>an</strong> (b)<br />

      <p>
        To take these ideas further, I expanded the Markov transition table into
        2nd and 3rd order, and I started creating sentences with rhyme schemes
        such as ababab, as verses from a poem:
      </p>

      Wards overnmen itselves citi<strong>es</strong> (a)<br />

      <p>
        Finally, I implemented combinations of rules in order to create a sonnet
        with a rhyme scheme abab cdcd efef gg:

        After generating the text, I transformed it into synthetic speech using
        AI-based voices that sound like Donald Trump (at a later stage I also
        added the voice of Joe Biden in the final section of the piece). Just to
        make it very clear, All the speech material existing in the piece has
        been artificially generated using an AI voice model: I used the app
        VoxBox by Myifone.<span class="popover-container">
          *<span class="popover-content">
            VoxBox by Myifone allows the user to generate speech using AI-based

        </span>
        No real speech has been used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially, the idea for this electronic speech material was to appear
        at certain points as a type of narrated nonsensical speech conceptually
        connected with the idea of rhetorical formulas that drive the musical
        narrative, which is essentially the same for both, as it can be seen
        from the explanation above. This speech would also serve as material for
        further electronic processes, like delays, granulation, time stretching,
        and so on, that would enrich the texture. However, after some more
        experimentation with it, the spoken part became a type of alter ego of
        the cello part. And for this, experimenting with AI glitches became the
        creative focus.
      </p>

      <h5>AI-voice glitches</h5>

      <p>
        The app VoxBox –and most AI voice generators– work as TTS
        (text-to-speech) systems: they synthesize speech from a text input.
        Usually, these models generate speech that is very realistic and in a
        relatively high audio quality. While creating the synthetic speech from
        the Markovian text, I started to observe some curious behaviors of these
        models when they received nonsensical text. Of course, these voices are
        trained with hours of real speech, which is tokenized as text that
        matches the input with the resulting generated voice. But what happens
        when this text input partially aligns with the training data, or
        sometimes it just doesn’t? Well, glitches.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not so obvious to observe these glitches in the higher order
        Markovian text, but as soon as one starts inputting impossible
        combinations of letters, such as those 1st order Markov examples, these
        glitches appear very evidently. Some of them were so distinctive and
        funny that I almost re-composed the whole electronic part just to make
        room for these. Ultimately, I believe they became strong protagonists,
        and potentially, the whole thing about steering the Markov generation
        became a bit overshadowed by these glitches.

      <h4>Strategies of <em>de-formalization</em></h4>

      <p>
        Even though the essence of the piece is connected to rhetoric and
        persuasive speaking as a politically dubious skill, in it, investigated
        some rather formalistic approaches to organize the musical narrative.
        Initially, I was optimistic about the idea of rhetoric and musical
        procedural rhetoric as a form of musical organization and how this could
        bring new insights to investigate ways of organizing the material.
        However, in the middle of the compositional process, I almost concluded
        that this idea was not so great.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after a cellist tested the earlier versions of the piece, it
        became evident that all these procedural formulations would not work
        musically or expressively without further refinement. The primary issue
        was that the procedurally created narrative was entirely divorced from
        the realities of its production process. This disconnect led to
        significant challenges, the most salient being that the piece was
        extremely difficult to play. Some gestures required excessive
        preparation or time to establish the sound, some others were rather
        impractical, and certain gestures often produced unintended residual
        noises that overshadowed their desired sonic effect. Even though the
        cellist was exceptional, most of the time, these difficulties and their
        resolution went frankly against the conceptual idea of the piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        After revisiting my initial compositional premises, my strategy was to
        <em>de-formalize</em> the piece, allowing it to evolve into a more
        organic musical work. By this, I mean a musical narrative that feels
        less like a battle between the performer and the instrument and more
        like a harmonious communion of the two. I believed that addressing these
        challenges would enable the piece to better embody its conceptual idea
        and envisioned narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, to address these problems, I took up the cello and started
        playing the piece myself. I am not a trained cellist, and of course,
        some sections of the piece required highly developed technical skills.
        However, those presented fewer compositional problems. In essence, my
        strategy was to test these playing techniques, whether it was possible
        to smoothly transit between them, whether these transitions would have
        some noticeable effect on the sound, and whether this could be done at a
        relatively steady pace. This became a rather physical approach, strongly
        connected to the production process of the cello and my physical
        capacities. In addition, and importantly, I tried to maintain a strong
        “predictive” approach in terms of how these embodied experiences would
        extrapolate to other performers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result of this new approach based on my own experience of playing
        the piece –and the cello– was, most of the time, playing against my
        initial formalizations. Therefore, some sections were removed, and some
        others changed almost completely. Some structures were broken, some
        gestures were shaped, and ultimately, some overall flexibility was
        allowed. The fragment below exemplifies this. Here, the different
        gestures for pitch bending are the result of a constraint rule, that
        simultaneously deals with two parameters:
        <em>pressure on the string</em> (low, high, and low to high or high to
        low) and <em>tremolo speed</em> (fast, slow, slow to fast, or fast to
        slow). Below can be seen how it was conceived initially conceived and
        notated. The staff below shows the last version of the same passage,
        where the symbols were replaced by handmade lines. In addition to these
        de-formalization strategies, the refinement of the notation played a
        crucial role, especially by the introduction of graphic elements –such
        as hand-made color lines and SVGs<span class="popover-container"

      <p>
        It can be argued that the underlying compositional structure still stems
        from constrained and procedural logic, which is ultimately a formal
        system, clearly expressed through the Lisp rules. The musical sound and
        gestures, and ultimately the way of notating them, reflect their
        <em>–embodied?–</em> production process. The nature of the constraint
        rules, when possible, adapts to the organicity needed to develop a
        narrative that reflects a broader poetic idea.
