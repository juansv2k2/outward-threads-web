        <h3>Oscillations</h3>
      </em>

      <p>
        The work <em>Oscillations</em> is a cycle of three pieces inspired by
        the lieder cycle <em>Winterreise,</em> written by W. Müller and set to
        music by F. Schubert. <em>Winterreise</em> explores themes of isolation,
        loneliness, existential questioning, and the search for purpose amid
        despair. I believe these themes remain profoundly relevant in today’s
        society. In the following discussion, I will examine some relevant
        aspects of this work, and later, I will trace some connections between
        these and the creative process for <em>Oscillations.</em>

      <p>
        <em>Winterreise</em> (German, <em>Winter trip</em> in English), is
        probably one of Schubert’s most profound compositions. It has been
        described as
        <em>
          “inspired by the poetry of Müller and its poeticized philosophy of
          existential torment”</em

            <em>Retracing a winter's journey: Schubert's Winterreise</em>
          </span>
        </span>
        The protagonist of the story is a young wanderer who embarks on a
        solitary journey after being abandoned by his beloved. However, Müller
        extends this theme beyond mere grief over a sweetheart’s infidelity,
        raising fundamental questions about the meaning of existence. As he
        travels, the wanderer seeks to understand both his own nature and that
        of Humanity through observing the external world as a fleeting landscape
        and through introspection and inward exploration.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            In this context, the idea of inward exploration refers to the search
            for deeper meaning or truth within oneself. The
            <em>Weg nach Innen</em> (German for <em>path inward</em>) is a
            concept from German Romanticism, particularly associated with the
            poet and philosopher Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg) and found in
            his unfinished novel <em>Heinrich von Ofterdingen.</em> Müller was
            familiar with Novalis’ work.
          </span>
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the cycle, the wanderer speaks to himself as if entirely
        alone, drawing the reader directly into his thoughts with no narrator or
        intermediary. According to Susan Youens, the reader appears as an
        <em>eavesdropper,</em> listening to things never meant to be overheard.
        In this sense, <em>Winterreise</em> is a monodrama and a precursor to
        Expressionist interior monologues.<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            A monodrama is a theatrical or musical work performed by a single
            actor or singer. It typically involves intense psychological depth
            and focuses on the inner world of the protagonist. Examples of
            monodramas are the works <em>Erwartung</em> (1909) by Marie
            Pappenheim and Arnold Schoenberg, and Schoenberg’s
            <em>Die Glückliche Hand</em> (1913).
          </span>
        </span>
        Furthermore, Müller deliberately adopts the style of German folk
        poetry<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            Wilhelm Muller was a German poet and writer who is known for his
            contributions to the development of the German Volkslied, or folk
            song. See for example <strong>Philip S. Allen,</strong> "Wilhelm
            Muller and the German Volkslied,"
            <em>Journal of Germanic Philology,</em> 3 (1900).
          </span>
        </span>
        in <em>Winterreise</em> to create a monodramatic effect. By avoiding
        complex poetic structures and the presence of multiple voices –such as a
        narrator or the poet himself– the poetry feels more direct and
        emotionally immediate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Susan Youens proposes that Müller was fond of <em>antitheses,</em> and
        this is reflected in the poetic style of <em>Winterreise:</em> as the
        wanderer walks, he shifts between self-reflection and outward
        observations of nature and mankind, while his psyche oscillates like a
        pendulum between euphoria and a longing for death, reality and
        imagination, and past and present. An example of this is the
        antithetical phrase “A stranger I arrived, / A stranger I depart” at the
        beginning of the first poem, “Gute Nacht,” which characterizes much of
        the cycle’s lyricism. These antithetic states and sensations appear
        throughout the entire cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wanderer experiences deep feelings throughout the cycle, yet Youens
        suggests he is also a realist with an analytical and philosophical mind.
        He sees his misery clearly and finds no comfort in dreams or fantasies
        because he doesn’t believe they have any connection to real life. To
        him, the divide between them is absolute. Returning to solitude and
        isolation after a brief escape into dreams is a recurring theme
        throughout the twenty-four songs. Youens provides an example of this in
        the poem “Frühlingstraum,” where the fleeting dream of green meadows and
        reciprocated love is followed by a sudden and acute awareness of cold
        and loneliness upon awakening.

        A recurring theme throughout the cycle, as discussed by Youens, is the
        difficulty of dying when one longs for it, or the persistence of life,
        even when unwanted. Yet the wanderer considers something like suicide
        only once, and even then, not by his own hand but as a passive surrender
        to nature. This moment, in the fifth song, “Der Lindembaum” (German,
        <em>Linden tree</em> in English),<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            In German literature, the linden tree often symbolizes home,
            comfort, and memory. It appears frequently in folk songs and poetry
            as a place of shelter, love, or longing. See for example
            <strong> Uwe Hentschel, </strong> "Der Lindenbaum in der deutschen
            Literatur des 18. und 19. Jahrhunderts,"

        is a key turning point. Until now, he has remained in the town of his
        beloved, and when he finally begins his journey, he is nearly stopped by
        the temptation to stay, lost in memory, and let the winter storm take
        him. Even though he doesn’t know why, he still holds to a trace of hope
        and chooses to keep moving.

            At the fountain outside the gate,<br />
            There stands a linden tree;<br />
            I dreamed in its shade<br />
            Many a sweet dream.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            I cut into its bark<br />
            Many a sweet word;<br />
            It drew me in joy and sorrow<br />
            I was always drawn away to him.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            I had to wander today too<br />
            Past in the deep night,<br />
            Still in the dark<br />
            I closed my eyes.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            And its branches rustled,<br />
            As if they were calling to me:<br />
            Come to me, fellow,<br />
            Here you'll find your rest!<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The cold winds blew<br />
            Straight into my face,<br />
            My hat flew off my head,<br />
            I did not turn.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I am many an hour<br />
            Away from that place,<br />
            And I can always hear it rustling:<br />

        Even as the linden tree’s voice, whispering of rest and peace in death,
        continues to haunt him, the poetry of <em>Winterreise</em> remains
        strikingly realistic. There are no fairy-tale or supernatural elements
        in the text. Instead, any seemingly “magical” moments –like the voices
        calling “Come here to me, fellow” in “Der Lindembaum”– originate from
        the wanderer’s own mind, and he is fully aware of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the final song, “Der Leiermann,” the wanderer encounters a solitary
        beggar playing a hurdy-gurdy. Youens interprets this old man as the
        wanderer’s <em>doppelgänger,</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            In German literature, the <em>Doppelgänger</em> represents a double
            or shadow self, often symbolizing inner conflict, fate, or an
            inescapable aspect of one’s identity. It appears in works by authors
            like E.T.A. Hoffmann and Heinrich Heine, frequently as a augury of
            doom or existential crisis. See for exampleAndrew J. Webber,

        According to Youens, <em>Winterreise</em> is usually interpreted as
        culminating in death or madness. However, despite the bleak emotional
        progression, the language of the wanderer remains consistent throughout
        the cycle. The landscape at the end –an unnamed town, a pack of dogs,
        snow, and ice, appears to return to the beginning of the journey,
        suggesting that the <em>Winterreise</em> has come full circle.

      <h4>Ekphrasis and Misreading</h4>
      <p>
        The work <em>Oscillations</em> proposes a re-imagination and
        re-composition of some songs of <em>Winterreise</em> through a personal
        vision and compositional approach. The work investigates several
        artistic inquiries. Some of them, as I see it, are at the intersection
        between human and artificial creative cognition: On the one hand, some
        musical and literary content of the cycle becomes prompt for a neural
        generative system. On the other hand, evocations and recollections are
        re-imagined as a new narrative for the poetry, a process that I view in
        analogy to prompt, but using a human mind as a latent space.
        Additionally, some musical references and poetic symbols from
        <em>Winterreise</em> are reimagined and incorporated as sources for
        re-composing them into a new musical work.

            My main personal and artistic motivation for composing this piece is

            to that, the deeply poetic and musical treatment of these issues in
            the cyclic has always strongly resonated with me. But how do I say

        There is a relatively common trend among some composers that write
        pieces that are <em>responses</em> to preexisting compositions, in
        particular Schubert’s works. For instance, Dániel Péter Biró’s
        <em> To Remember and Forget</em> (1999-2000),<span
          class="popover-container"

            A detailed analysis of <em>To Remember and to Forget</em> can be
            found in
            <strong>D. Biró,</strong>
            "Remembering and Forgetting: Lizkor VeLishkoach for String Quartet,

        </span>
        a response piece to Schubert’s <em>Quartet in G major</em> (D887).
        Similarly, Hans Zender’s <em>Winterreise</em> (1993) is a
        reinterpretation of Schubert-Müller’s <em>Winterreise,</em> and Henrik
        Hellstenius’s <em>Dichterliebe</em> (2015), a re-composition of the
        Schumann-Heine cycle, among many others. Some theorists have described
        this approach as <em>ekphrastic.</em> In this way, there is something
        ekphrastic in <em>Oscillations,</em> as each piece is an original work
        inspired by and connected to the cycle <em>Winterreise.</em>

        Ekphrasis, in its classical form, is primarily a discoursive technique
        that aims to vividly represent absent objects or scenes for an audience,
        making the listener feel like an eyewitness.<span

          </span>
        </span>
        However, in modern interpretations, the use of ekphrasis has shifted
        towards a focus on the explicit representation of visual artworks.<span

        Furthermore, contemporary ekphrasis extends beyond just visual art,
        touching on other art forms like music. This idea shifts ekphrasis from
        a mere descriptive practice to a dynamic interplay between multiple
        artistic mediums. These can either reflect direct influences from other
        artistic works or re-imagine them in a practice that potentially brings
        new dimensions and interpretations: a form of creative
        <em>re-presentation.</em

        The composer Luciano Berio, for example, wrote a piece named
        <em>Ekphrasis (Continuo II)</em> in 1996. As its name indicates, the
        work functions as a commentary on an earlier composition of his: the
        1990 orchestral piece called <em>Continuo.</em> There is another piece
        by Luciano Berio, however, that interests me more, as it also takes as a
        departure point the music of Franz Schubert: The piece
        <em>Rendering</em> (1990) for symphonic orchestra. According to his own
        words, Berio composed this piece in the form of a restoration of
        Schubert’s <em>Tenth Symphony in D major</em>
        (D936A):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Seduced by those sketches, I therefore decided to restore them:
          restore and not complete nor reconstruct. […] I proposed to follow, in
          spirit, those modern criteria of restoration that address the problem
          of rekindling the old colors without hiding the damage of time and the
          inevitable gaps created in the composition (as is the case with Giotto
          in Assisi).”

        Schubert’s symphony sketches were left in pianistic form, with
        occasional instrumental suggestions. Berio’s restoration focused on
        completing the internal voices and bass lines, along with orchestrating
        the piece, aiming to preserve Schubert’s characteristic color, though
        not exclusively, as Berio refers to using orchestration techniques
        resembling Mendelsohn and Mahler in <em>Rendering.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To bridge the gaps between sketches, Berio gradually introduces new
        musical material that slowly emerges, first coexisting with Schubert and
        later taking over the orchestral texture. This connecting tissue –as he
        defines it– is constantly different and changing, always
        <em>pianissimo</em> and <em>lontano.</em> Even though the new material
        feels entirely distinct from Schubert’s, Berio manages to knit them in
        an undeniably beautiful and masterfully conceived form.

        For example, the fragment below shows some abbreviated quotations of the
        main theme from the <em>Piano Sonata in B-flat major.</em> The first
        oboe, trumpet and clarinet play the first three notes before diverging.
        Soon after, the first oboe diminishes the rhythm. The violins play the
        motive as repeated sixteen-notes. Finally, the celesta presents the
        first phrase of the theme in its literal melodic form, without harmony,
        doubled by the second violins.

        In <em>Rendering,</em> some references to <em>Winterreise</em> can be
        observed. For instance, the beginning of “Wasserflut” (the sixth song of
        the cycle), characterized by its intervals (ascending perfect fifth,
        ascending and descending perfect fourth), is rhythmically condensed here
        into a succession of three appoggiaturas followed by a long note, as it
        can be seen in the score above, in the first trumpet and first clarinet
        (here the quotation to “Wasserflut” overlaps with a quotation to the
        <em>Piano Sonata in B flat major)</em>. Later, the first oboe and first
        trumpet play an rhythmically augmented version of the same motive.
        Additionally, there is a reference to “Die Post” (the thirteenth song)
        in the first flute at rehearsal mark 9, featuring its characteristic
        broken chord and triplet rhythmic feel, as shown below:

      <p>
        In this piece, Berio seems to invert the concept of historical material
        as exemplified earlier in Bernd Zimmermann’s work. Rather than allowing
        historical elements to emerge organically within a contemporary
        framework, <em>Rendering</em> introduces the contemporary only
        sparingly, serving as a subtle connective tissue that binds together
        Schubert’s fragmented sketches. The collision of the historical material
        with the new, the <em>dreamy</em> texture and their intertwining shocked
        me greatly at first listening and every time after.
      </p>

      <h4>Creative Process</h4>
      <p>
        The cycle <em>Oscillations</em> is inspired by, and both musically and
        poetically rooted in the music and poetry of <em>Winterreise.</em> In
        particular, Müller’s poetic concept of <em>antithesis,</em> discussed
        above, is reinterpreted as a central creative idea for the piece: the
        notion of oscillating musical states, in relation to themes of
        <em>deviation, drifting,</em> and <em>return.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The nature of these oscillations and how it is creatively explored
        varies across the three pieces. <em>Oscillations (i)</em> essentially
        draws material from the poems “Gute Nacht,” “Gefrorene Tränen,” and
        “Erstarrung.” <em>Oscillations (ii)</em> uses “Der Lindembaum” as its
        starting point –also incorporating a covered quotation of the piano part
        from “Gute Nacht.” <em>Oscillations (iii)</em> takes inspiration and
        material from “Der Leiermann” and includes a covered quotation of the
        poetry of “Mut!” After exploring more abstract constructive processes in
        <em>Oscillations (i),</em> the work gradually evolves into a form of
        melodrama,<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content"
            >The difference between monodrama and melodrama is that a melodrama
            usually consists of narrated voice instead of a sung part.
          </span>
        </span>
        imaginatively connected to a strongly emotional personal history through
        the use of sonic memories, literary narratives, and staging.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of the opposite process is <em>Oscillations (ii).</em> There,
        quotations from the original drive the narrative, and these materials
        become characters that interact with other new elements, perhaps
        clashing or establishing a co-existence but essentially fading into each
        other or emerging. Somehow, connected to Berio’s idea in
        <em>Rendering.</em> Finally, in <em>Oscillations (iii),</em> the
        historical materials shift away from their original form and then return
        to it, a process that repeats back and forth throughout the sections.
        Additionally, the narrated part mirrors this transformation through a
        mental drifting, using the original verses of the poem –translated into
        English– as its point of departure.

            What is <em>intuition?</em> Intuition is the formation of

            experiences that share meaning or similarity are mentally
            associated. Memories connect with objects: photos evoke sounds,
            sounds bring voices, voices recall faces, faces stir emotions,

        Part of the creative investigation in this piece explores intuition
        –both human and artificial– and the intuitive connections that can shape
        narrative and larger musical forms. One example of this is how I use the
        notion of <em>prompt:</em
        ><span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            <em>Prompt</em> here is understood in the same sense as in LLMs,
            which refers to an initial input that guides the model’s response.
            In this context, this word is relevant because I am generating
            musical continuations; however, the terminology varies in machine
            learning, where we would typically refer to it as an input that
            determines a predictive model’s output.
          </span>
        </span>
        on the one hand, as an initializer of a generative musical process; on
        the other hand, as a catalyzer for a narrated part based on personal
        recollections, mixed with an imagined present reality. I use these two
        ideas metaphorically and analogously, equating them to the exploration
        of a latent space within a human mind –my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first idea, in this work, I experimented using the tool
        NeuralConstraints, which allows the generation of musical sequences
        guided by neural network predictions while constrained by additional
        rules defined by the composer. For example, the neural network can be
        trained on the music of the cycle <em>Winterreise,</em>
        and its outcome will be shaped by this learned data, while other rules
        such as allowed notes, intervals, or rhythmic repetitions shape these
        predictions into desired musical structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        NeuralConstraints mainly works based on predictions for some input
        sequences. To generate a musical continuation, it usually starts from a
        musical prompt. For example, it receives four, or five, or whatever
        number of consecutive pitches, and it will try to predict the
        continuation. This is done sequentially step by step: the predicted
        outcome becomes the input for a new prediction. Therefore, these
        continuations can go for as long as desired. Naturally, these
        predictions are not always precise, and some deviations occur.
        Eventually, these errors start to accumulate and slowly drift away from
        the expected result.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gradual deviation became a strong compositional heuristic
        throughout the whole work. In particular, when it takes as a departure
        point some literal elements of the cycle, such as some vocal melodies or
        piano parts. It is possible, for example, to steer the neural generation
        and deviation by embedding certain rules for the network to follow, or
        one can establish a set of rules that allow predictions to wander off
        while eventually returning to a targeted outcome, such as a melodic
        progression leading to a cadence. In the examples below, this is done
        through neural generation using NeuralConstraints. Later, I will discuss
        other examples where the “deviation” heuristic was implemented outside
        the computational system:

      <h5>Prompting semantic connections</h5>
      <p>
        The narrated part of <em>Oscillations (iii)</em> was conceived to
        reflect the melodramatic essence found in Müller’s poetic style
        throughout <em>Winterreise.</em> Here, the narrator speaks to himself,
        in a manner not meant to be overheard. As in the original cycle, the
        audience is positioned as a silent observer within the narrator’s mind.
        The language is overtly colloquial and politically incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, this narrated part reframes the idea of prompting
        –somewhat connected to its musical use explained above, but this time as
        a metaphor for a mental drift triggered by the verses of the poem “Der
        Leiermann.” In this sense, this type of oscillating mental state –which
        is commonplace along the full cycle– here has been used not just as a
        compositional resource, but also as a literary mode: the original verses
        appear at the beginning and at the end of the narration, pronounced with
        a poetic narrative voice. Subsequently and over the three sections of
        the piece, a slow process of <em>drifting</em> takes place. Initially,
        the tone becomes totally intimate and personal, and the narrative shifts
        in time and space through memory evocations, yet some of the verses
        still evoke the original verses of the original poem. In the image below
        can be observed the narrated part and how it relates to “Der Leiermann.”
        The bold italics are indications of character for the narrator.

        <h4>Electronics</h4>
        <p>
          The electronics in the piece are mainly based on sound samples, as
          well as some live processing of the instruments of the ensemble. A
          significant component also includes the use of soundscapes. These
          sonic references to objects and environments are intended to evoke
          some associations in the listener, connecting the sounds to emotional
          abstractions, specific times, or places. For instance, in
          <em>Oscillations (i),</em> a soundscape of wind and footsteps in the
          snow evokes a clear reference to the original
          <em>Winterreise.</em> This not only ties to the poetry but also
          creates a symbolic musical connection to Franz Schubert’s music,
          particularly through the “journeying” motive, a non-legato, repeated
          pitch pattern that often appears at the beginning or end of some
          songs, symbolizing the footsteps of the wanderer.<span

        <p>
          I was particularly interested in incorporating sonic elements tied to
          memories of a specific past time, likely situated around the late
          1980s/early 1990s. These are evoked through electronic sample sounds
          –such as telephone ringing tones and cassette players in
          <em>Oscillations (ii)</em> and <em>Oscillations (iii),</em> and
          radio-related sounds like dial sweepings and white noise along with
          certain musical fragments in <em>Oscillations (iii).</em> In addition,
          the visual narrative proposes an aesthetic strongly related to that
          particular time, by the use of analog VHS effects and glitches.
        </p>
        <h5>Evocations and Connections</h5>
        <p>
          One of the creative ideas of these pieces was intended to create
          musical connections between the oscillating mental states of the
          wanderer in the original <em>Winterreise</em> and certain sonic and
          musical material and developments in <em>Oscillations.</em> These
          connections were intended to evoke the emotional landscape inspired by
          some of the poems of the cycle, in order to make more vivid the
          psychological experience of the wanderer. Other connections come from
          more semantic and referential associations, such as some train sounds
          and steps as references to movement and displacement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of musical connections to evoke emotions has a long history in
          Western music,<span class="popover-container"
            >*
            <span class="popover-content">
              Particularly relevant is the concept of <em>affects</em> in the
              Renaissance and Baroque periods and their connection to rhetoric.
              I will revisit this later to discuss the background of the piece
              <em>Elevator Pitch.</em>

          with a vast tradition that has produced many clichés. However, my
          associations between music and emotions are strongly shaped by my
          personal, familial, social, and cultural background. In particular,
          much of my subjectivity is deeply connected to musical traditions from
          my country, from films, television, music that discovered while
          growing up, music that I involuntarily listened to, music that I
          studied at University, and many other sources that are stored in my
          memory. This inevitably biases my creative. That said, I deliberately
          attempted to resist the force of cliché by developing more subtle,
          covert ways of incorporating these connections. This approach could be
          seen as a heuristic strategy: <em>Do it, but not so obviously.</em>

              I’ve come to realize that this is a common practice in WACM.
              However, the underlying reason for this tendency
              <em> —to do it, but not so obviously— </em> is less clear. Issues
              such as expectations, valuations, relevance, stylistic
              considerations, etc., undoubtedly influence these decisions.
              Still, I know I would never make these connections overtly. Why?
              That remains an open question.

        <p>
          In <em>Oscillations (i),</em> my focus was on evoking spectrum of
          emotions such as despair, love, and contemplation. Clearly,
          <em>Winterreise</em> addresses a much more nuanced emotional range.
          However, I chose to distill these states into three broad emotional
          abstractions<span class="popover-container"
            >*
            <span class="popover-content">
              Again, this idea might be seen in connection to the idea of
              <em>affects,</em> as existed in the Renaissance and Baroque.
            </span>
          </span>
          that, when explored musically, might lead to diverse outcomes.
          Essentially, the choice of singing style and some of the electronic
          sounds are aimed at triggering some association between them and these
          emotions. For example, some historical connotations that the musical
          material evokes, such as an expressive <em>arioso</em> line, might be
          strongly associated with love and affection. On the other hand, a low
          and dark vocal fry might relate to anxiety and despair.

          In terms of the presence of literal elements from the cycle within the
          music, I conveyed a certain sense of presence by bringing in
          reminiscent components, like melodic contours or fragments of poetry.
          Occasionally, recognizable musical or literary elements emerge
          dramatically.

          Some other times, the connections between the original
          <em>Winterreise</em> and <em>Oscillations</em> are structural and
          abstract, and non directly perceptually relatable. For example, I use
          melodic profiles, such as from the song “Gute Nacht,” as a break-point
          functions that later I use to create new melodic profiles, using
          processes of expansion and contraction.<span class="popover-container"

          The three pieces that make up the cycle are designed to be independent
          and can be performed individually. However, some connections can be
          traced between them. I often use acoustic pattern-based matching –such
          as equivalent energy curves of certain gestures– to create aural
          connections between the pieces. For example, a
          <em>crescendo</em> sound that originates from a heavily processed
          sample (the pedal of a piano is struck and allowed to resonate, then
          inverted) that gradually overtakes the entire texture and culminates
          in a sudden silence, can be found along the three pieces of the cycle.
          Usually, this gesture marks the end of a formal section.

          The granulation of the same pedal sound sample discussed above
          resulted in a sound that resembles the march of a train. This sound
          can be heard along the three pieces as a blueprint that creates a
          certain sense of dynamism and movement.

        <h5>Visuals</h5>

          Finally, the element that connects the three pieces of
          <em>Oscillations</em>
          is the visuals. The composition of this layer was in charge of Andrea
          Urstad Toft. We had several meetings in which we discussed possible
          connections between the music and the visual narratives. A common
          point was the use of VHS aesthetics, especially tape glitches. In
          terms of material, my role was concerned with general suggestions of
          elements, or pointing at the poetry of
          <em>Winterreise</em> as a source of imagery.

          The first piece, <em>Oscillations (i)</em> is time-locked to the
          visuals, requiring the singer to follow a click track to synchronize
          the music with the video. <em>Oscillations (ii)</em> is not
          time-locked; we defined formal sections and selected specific video
          material for each. The choice of effects and processes was entrusted
          to Andrea, with the premise of maintaining a strong connection to the
          aesthetic we sought. In <em>Oscillations (iii),</em> we incorporated
          live filming and projection of the performers, following the idea of
          the doppelgänger in “Der Leiermann” as a projection of the narrator.
          This concept was extended to the other performers, who are also
          projected live while playing.
