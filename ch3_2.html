      <h2>Cognition and Intelligence</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <em>Cognition</em> and <em>Intelligence</em> are essentially two
        different things. On the one hand, cognition is defined as:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding
          through thought, experience, and the senses. […] It is in essence, the
          ability to perceive and react, process and understand, store and
          retrieve information, make decisions and produce appropriate
          responses.”

          “A mental quality consisting of the abilities to learn from
          experience, adapt to new situations, understand and handle abstract

        Essentially, cognition encompasses the processes of information, while
        intelligence represents the capacity to effectively use it. Broadly
        speaking, cognition can be exhibited not only by humans but also by
        other life forms and even technological artifacts.<span

      <p>
        Within the field of psychology, there are three main approaches to
        contemporary cognitive theory. The first is the information-processing
        approach, which compares the human mind to a sophisticated computer
        system designed to acquire, process, store, and use information. This
        paradigm is widely known as <em>cognitivism.</em> The second paradigm
        draws inspiration from the structural design of the brain, specifically
        focusing on the connectivity patterns among neurons. This theoretical
        approach is known as <em>connectionism.</em> Essentially, it views the
        mind as a vast pattern recognition system that learns and constantly
        adjusts itself based on sensory input data. A third component of the
        overall framework of human cognition is the
        <em>embodied</em> perspective. This approach argues that cognition is
        not merely the product of internal mental processes but is deeply
        intertwined with sensory-motor experiences and interactions with the
        environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        These three paradigms form the primary categorical distinctions in the
        study of human cognition. In the following chapters, I examine each in
        greater detail, relating them to the creative processes for each of the
        works that constitute the artistic outcome of this project. Before
        exploring these paradigms further, however, it is essential to address
        some foundational concepts. I begin with a central dichotomy in
        cognition, with deep implications for creative processes: the
        distinction between <em>conscious</em> and
        <em>unconscious</em> cognition.
      </p>
      <h3>Consciousness vs. Unconsciousness</h3>

      <p>
        <em>Consciousness</em> is defined as
        <em>
          the state of being aware of and responsive to one’s surroundings</em
        >.<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            <strong>Oxford English Dictionary</strong>,
            <em>"consciousness, n,"</em>
            in <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (Oxford University Press,
            2024).
          </span>
        </span>
        However, since ancient times, consciousness has been the subject of
        study, analyses, explanations, and large philosophical, scientific, and
        even religious debates. There are multiple opinions and approaches on
        what is or should be considered consciousness or even what exactly needs
        to be studied to better understand it. As my background and my research
        interest come mainly from the perspective of psychology and cognitive
        sciences, I will narrow down the discussion to theories of consciousness
        within this field.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary manifestation of consciousness is rooted in the distinction
        between the <em>self</em> and the environment. Consciousness involves a
        state characterized by sensations, emotions, volition, and thought.
        While consciousness and the concept of mind are strongly interconnected,
        they are often viewed as distinct entities. The mind represents the
        content of our experiences, while consciousness is the perceiver of
        these experiences. Consciousness, then, refers to the unchanging and
        continuous aspect of our experience, while the mind is ever-changing.
        Some authors use the analogy of a movie theater to illustrate this
        distinction, where the mind is akin to the content of the film, and
        consciousness is the screen upon which the movie is projected.<span
          class="popover-container"

          <span class="popover-content">
            See for example the work of <strong>Daniel Dennett</strong> in Ch.
            4, in <strong>Susan Blackmore</strong>,
            <em>Consciousness: an introduction,</em> 2nd edition (Oxford
            University Press, 2011).
          </span>
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, psychologists and cognitive scientists generally
        agree on the existence of an unconscious mind. Daniel Kahneman, for
        example, distinguishes between two types of mental processes: fast
        activities, which are primarily automatic and effortless, and slow
        activities, which are deliberate, effortful, and associated with
        subjective experiences of agency, choice, and concentration.<span

          </span>
        </span>
        Kahneman’s two systems roughly correspond to conscious and unconscious
        processes. A further refinement of this duality is found in the
        <em>dual-process</em> theory, which describes human information
        processing through two main cognitive modes: Type 1, which is fast,
        automatic, and handles large volumes of data intuitively, and Type 2,
        which is slow, deliberate, and processes information sequentially in a
        more effortful manner with limited capacity.<span

        The classic literature on unconscious cognition suggests that this type
        of processing arises from subliminal perception, where stimuli are
        detected without conscious <em>attention</em>.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            <em>Attention</em> is a pillar concept in the field of cognition and
            brain sciences. It is defined as a state in which cognitive
            resources are focused on certain aspects of the environment rather
            than on others and the central nervous system is in a state of
            readiness to respond to stimuli. Since humans have a limited
            capacity for attention, focusing on certain stimuli at the expense
            of others, much of the research in this field has focused on
            understanding the factors that influence attention and the neural
            mechanisms behind selective information processing.
            <em>“Attention”</em> in <strong>Gary R. Vandenbos</strong>,

            Association (2007).
          </span>
        </span>
        Researchers studying unconscious cognition often examine how memory
        traces of these unattended stimuli influence cognition and behavior,
        even when individuals cannot consciously recall the experiences. From
        this perspective, unconscious cognition is typically viewed as having
        limited analytical capabilities, contributing less information to our
        conscious experience compared to to consciously perceived stimuli.<span

        However, contemporary research trends regarding unconscious cognition
        have proposed an alternative perspective that acknowledges the
        unconscious as a sophisticated and adaptive guidance system. Some
        authors argue against equating the unconscious mind solely with
        subliminal processing, citing evidence of complex judgmental and
        behavioral phenomena that operate outside direct conscious awareness. In
        this view, an unconscious goal pursuit, influenced by evolutionary
        motives, operates similarly to a conscious goal pursuit. The
        contemporary model of unconscious cognition emphasizes the role of
        genes, culture, and early learning in shaping unconscious
        processes.<span class="popover-container"

        According to K. Hayles, potentially the most important function of
        unconscious cognition is:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “to keep consciousness, with its slow uptake and its limited
          processing ability, from being overwhelmed with the floods of exterior
          and interior information streaming into the brain every millisecond.”

            Following this line of thought, it seems like the distinction
            between conscious and unconscious thought is essentially connected
            to intentionality. We have intention over our conscious thought, but
            we lack it over our unconscious. I believe that this statement is
            somehow familiar to art practitioners when discussing certain
            practices that involve a lack of intentionality or a lack of
            reasoning. In particular, when we discuss art creation as an
            intuitive practice. But what is <em>intuition?</em>

      </blockquote>
      <h3>Intuitive vs. Rational</h3>

      <p>
        The <em>intuitive </em>and the <em>rational</em> are two terms that are
        probably familiar to every art practitioner. The rational is often
        associated with logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations to solve
        well-defined problems, relying on explicit, conscious thought processes.
        Intuition, on the other hand, involves arriving at conclusions or
        insights without explicit reasoning. It often feels like an immediate
        awareness of a solution, idea, or decision. While the rational is
        closely linked to intelligence, characterized by the deliberate and
        systematic application of knowledge, the intuitive remains more elusive
        and harder to define.
      </p>

      <p>
        Intuition is a form of cognition. Chassy and Gobet have proposed a list
        of key criteria for determining it:
        <em>
          (1) rapid perception and understanding of the situation at hand, (2)
          lack of awareness of the processes involved, (3) holistic
          understanding of the problem situation, (4) the fact that experts’
          decisions are better than novices’ even when they are made without
          analytical means, and (5) concomitant presence of emotional
          coloring.</em

        Ultimately, intuition can be understood as the intersection of
        perception, knowledge, and emotions, acting as a bridge between
        situational, bodily knowledge and unconscious understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two primary categories of theories on intuition. The first
        explains it from a mechanistic perspective, focusing on specific
        cognitive mechanisms and processes such as pattern recognition and
        <em>chunking</em>.<span class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content"
            >In cognitive psychology, <em>chunking</em> is a process by which
            small individual pieces of information are bound together to create
            a meaningful whole later on in memory. For example, when we group
            numbers by two or three to easily remember a phone number.
          </span>
        </span>
        According to this view, experts acquire a large number of perceptual
        patterns (or "chunks") that help them make rapid and intuitive
        decisions.<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            <strong>Fernand Gobet and Herbert A. Simon</strong>, "Five Seconds
            or Sixty? Presentation Time in Expert Memory,"
            <em>Cognitive Science</em> 24, no. 4 (2000),
            <a
              href="https://doi.org/10.1207/s15516709cog2404_4"

            >.
          </span>
        </span>
        Chassy and Gobet further extended this framework by introducing the
        concept of <em>templates,</em> which are more complex memory structures
        enabling experts to rapidly and holistically understand situations.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">
            Templates are a special type of chunk that possess both a core, made
            of stable information, and slots, made of variable information. For
            example, if we think of the template of a “room” the fact that rooms
            have a floor, a ceiling, and walls, would constitute the core,
            whereas the number of doors and windows would be encoded as
            variables. In <strong>Philippe Chassy</strong> and
            <strong>Fernand Gobet</strong>, "A hypothesis about the biological
            basis of expert intuition," 200.
          </span>
        </span>
        The second category emphasizes the development of intuition through
        experience, context, and holistic understanding. This theory suggests
        that intuition evolves as individuals progress from novices to experts,
        with increasing experience leading to a more fluid and intuitive grasp
        of situations, without relying on the detailed mechanistic explanations
        of the first category.<span class="popover-container"

      </p>

      <p>
        Emotions play a crucial role in intuition, as Chassy and Gobet suggest.
        When individuals acquire expertise, they not only develop perceptual
        chunks but also learn which elements are beneficial, harmful, or neutral
        to their task. These chunks are associated with emotional responses,
        such as reward or punishment, which are integrated into memory
        structures. As a result, emotional relevance is recalculated when new
        items are chunked together. In future situations, these emotional
        responses help focus attention on the most useful chunks, guiding
        intuitive decision-making by steering individuals toward certain
        solutions over others.<span class="popover-container"

        Certain artistic practices, especially those outside academic or
        institutionalized contexts, are often described as rooted in intuitive
        knowledge. The development of expertise in these areas is typically
        linked to extended exposure to a particular way of doing, which doesn’t
        necessarily involve a rational approach or learning a system of rules,
        principles, or axioms governing those practices. However, certain other
        practices –and, in particular, the case of music composition is a good
        example of this– are discussed as potentially relying on two
        antagonistic approaches: on the one hand, an intuitive approach, and on
        the other hand, an approach focused more on strategic and structural
        aspects. This dichotomy, however, is posed more as a continuum or
        spectrum rather than a clear-cut dichotomy.<span

        In particular, when we speak about creativity in art, the ideas about
        conscious and unconscious processes, or rational and intuitive, have a
        long-standing presence in the discourse. For example, the classic model
        of creativity by Graham Wallas already differentiated between conscious
        and unconscious thought processes within his well-known four stages:
        <em> preparation, incubation, illumination, </em>and
        <em>verification.</em

        In some of these stages, there is deliberate control over the thought
        process, and that control is totally or partially absent in others.

        The topic of human creativity is extensive and multifaceted and can be
        approached from several fields, such as psychology, sociology,
        philosophy, or even computation. This complexity derives mainly from two
        perspectives. First, from the discussion of
        <em>what</em> counts as a creative idea.<span class="popover-container"
          >*
          <span class="popover-content">

            <em>The creative mind: myths and mechanisms.</em>
          </span>
        </span>
        In this sense, creativity is viewed as a contextually embedded
        phenomenon,<span class="popover-container"

        and as such, creative acts are viewed as creative, novel, or valuable
        depending on the social context in which they are embedded. Second, from
        the complexity around identifying the mental processes –and its neural
        basis– that produce those ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically, the study of creativity has been focused on the
        relationship between creative behavior and intelligence or personality.
        However, in recent times, the focus on studying creativity has switched
        to a sociocultural approach. This view emphasizes that creative
        processes are not solely individual but are distributed across people,
        objects, places, and institutions. Ultimately, the study of human
        creativity has led to the recent development of frameworks by cultural
        and sociocultural psychologists that acknowledge its simultaneous
        psychological and cultural nature.

      <p>
        I believe that this question is crucial, especially in the context of
        music creation, and specifically WACM: The relationship between music
        composition an intra-personal act versus a contextually embedded
        phenomenon shaped by institutional forces, social capital, and even
        economic and political factors. What follows aims to bridge these two
        approaches by looking into creativity as an intra-personal exploration
        within socially constructed spaces of thought: conceptual spaces. In
        order to do that, I must first address an important topic:
        <em>the conceptual level</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>The Conceptual Level</h3>
      <p>
        The issue of how concepts and categories are represented and organized
        in our minds is a major challenge in cognitive science. A proposed
        solution to this problem is the idea of
        <em>conceptual spaces,</em> introduced by Peter Gärdenfors.<span
          class="popover-container"
          >*<span class="popover-content">
            <strong>Peter Gärdenfors,</strong>
            <em>"Conceptual Spaces: The Geometry of Thought</em>
            (The MIT Press, 2000),
            <a
              href="https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/2076.001.0001"

              https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/2076.001.0001 </a
            >.
          </span>
        </span>
        This theory essentially portrays the human mind as a geographical space
        in which concepts are organized by proximity. The idea of conceptual
        space posits that concepts are not rigid categories with defined
        boundaries. Instead, they are multi-dimensional spaces –or regions–
        within a cognitive domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The construction of these spaces is based on perceptual and cognitive
        attributes relevant to a particular concept. Therefore, concepts are not
        represented as individual symbols or set categories but rather as
        geometric configurations within a multi-dimensional space that exists in
        the mind. Each dimension represents a distinct quality or property
        relating to the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conceptual spatial representation allows for a flexible understanding of
        similarities between concepts. Accordingly, cognitive processes like
        similarity assessment or categorization can be better explained by the
        proximity –or distance– between concepts in a conceptual space. For
        example, the color space, usually discussed as an archetype of a
        conceptual space, has quality dimensions such as
        <em>hue, saturation,</em> and <em>lightness.</em> In this space,
        similarly colored stimuli are closer together while differing colors are
        farther apart.

        To better envision the idea of how conceptual spaces are extremely
        complex representations in the mind, usually involving many quality
        dimensions, Geraint Wiggins proposes an example of a spoken phrase and
        how it is mentally represented in terms of conceptual spaces (in this
        particular case, the representation is limited to the different time
        regularities existing on a sonic stimuli). The schematization of the
        model supposes that it has been exposed to the English language and
        speech and that it has learned the components of the example sentence.
        Still, this is an example of an idealized representation. In reality,
        conceptual spaces would potentially involve many more sensory dimensions
        as well as semantic dimensions.

        From this perspective, it becomes relatively clear how the concept of
        conceptual spaces, along with their inherent complexity and
        multidimensionality, relates to creativity. However, connecting this
        idea back to artistic creation as a process of exploration, using the
        metaphor of the labyrinth as I discussed in the introduction, becomes
        more challenging to imagine, since any creative exploration would entail
        a complex network of interrelated multisensory and semantic spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Margaret Boden proposes that, as models for creative processes,
        conceptual spaces comprise essentially
        <em>structured styles of thought,</em
        ><span class="popover-container"

          <span class="popover-content">

            <em>The creative mind: myths and mechanisms,</em> 4.
          </span>
        </span>
        rather than solely multisensory experiences. These styles of thought
        encompass a wide range of creative expressions, including music,
        writing, sculpting, illustration, and countless other cultural practices
        –like fashion and cuisine, among others. Additionally, Boden highlights
        that these conceptual spaces are not just individual constructs. Rather,
        they draw from existing societal ideas and are shaped by our
        interactions with the world.
      </p>
      <h4>Formal systems</h4>
      <p>
        Margaret Boden’s model of human creativity revolves around the notion of
        conceptual spaces as a process of exploration of these very complex
        conceptual spaces.<span class="popover-container"

        But how are these spaces explored? As I mentioned in the introduction to
        this text and as somehow became clear after the lengthy theoretical
        discussion from before, there are different ways of doing it.
        Potentially, one related to logical steps and reason, and another one
        related to intuitive moves. Concerning the first, Boden proposes that
        explorations of these spaces are based on
        <em>formal systems.</em> Douglas Hofstadter defines a formal system as
        sets of rules and symbols used to create and manipulate statements or
        strings of symbols. Importantly, there is no need to attribute inherent
        meaning to these symbols; the exploration can remain agnostic to the
        content being explored.<span class="popover-container"
          >*

        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach has been a common creative and exploratory practice,
        especially in WACM. Particulalry illustrative of this is the example of
        the European post-war avant-garde movements, which developed a creative
        trend by applying combinatorial formulas to organize musical parameters,
        particularly pitch, and rhythm, though not limited to these alone.
        However, the concept of a formal system in music can extend beyond the
        combinatorial –and somewhat rudimentary– logic of some avant-garde
        methods. Counterpoint rules, harmonic structures, and even principles of
        orchestration can be understood as formal systems: chords unfold based
        on harmonic patterns, and melodies interact within polyphonic textures
        according to specific intervallic movements, both horizontally and
        vertically. For instance, when a musical movement “X” is allowed, it may
        restrict another movement “Y.” Choosing one movement constrains the
        following possibilities unless condition “Z” intervenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these rules have formed a logical framework that has been the
        cornerstone of music composition, dating back to early polyphonic music
        in the Middle Ages. What may sound like a logical, computer-like method,
        in fact, has been an important way of exploring creative spaces in music
        –and I will dedicate the next chapter to better understanding this
        process as it unfolds within my creative practice. However, there is an
        important concept that needs to be introduced here, and that is the
        notion of <em>heuristics.</em>
      </p>
      <h4>Heuristics</h4>
      <p>
        Heuristics are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that simplify
        decision-making or problem-solving, often providing quick but not always
        optimal solutions. In AI, heuristics are used to speed up algorithms by
        guiding them toward likely solutions, aiming to balance efficiency with
        accuracy in complex problem-solving tasks. Furthermore, using heuristics
        helps us avoid repeating or going through unneeded steps in any process.
        Sometimes, heuristics processes allow us to “jump” the walls of the
        labyrinth by breaking some rules to prioritize some desired outcomes.
        For example, it is common to see in some great composers how they broke
        some harmonic rules –such as the prohibition of moving harmonic voices
        in parallel 5ths or 8ves– in order to prioritize a beautiful melodic
        result.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first sight, heuristic thinking, which is a capacity that is very
        familiar to human art practitioners, is a crucial separation between
        human creativity and computational algorithms. However, the idea of
        heuristics also exists in AI, and computers are far from being stupid
        logical calculators –and this has been the case for a long time!
        Nonetheless, composing music solely through formal systems at some point
        became almost prescriptive for many contemporary composers, who focused
        exclusively on the symbolic dimension of music. Whether this approach
        was –or is– valid or not is an issue that spills into broader
        philosophical, ideological, historical, technical, and ultimately
        aesthetic discussions. However, it is a question that I will explore
        further in the following chapter, ‘The Cognitivist Paradigm.’ Computers,
        especially with the advent of AI, have proven to be powerful tools in
        this area. So, let me now shift attention from human cognition to AI and
        examine relevant concepts in this field.
